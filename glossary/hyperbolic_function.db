A group of functions related to the trigonometric
functions:

\par
hyperbolic sin of x is written sinh(x) (pronounced 'shine x')
\par
hyperbolic cos of x is written cosh(x) ('cosh x')
\par
hyperbolic tan of x is written tanh(x) ('tansh x')
\par
Definitions;
sinh(x) = [exp(x) - exp(-x)]/2
\par
cosh(x) = [exp(x) + exp(-x)]/2
\par
tanh(x) = sinh(x)/cosh(x)

\par
There are also sech, coth and cosech, defined as 
1/cosh, 1/sinh and 1/tanh respectively.
