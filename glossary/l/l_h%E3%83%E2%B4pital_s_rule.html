<p>The prime factorisation of a number is the way of writing that number as a product of prime numbers. There is only one way to do this for each number (apart from just changing the order of the prime numbers).</p>
<p>For instance, the prime factorisation of 60 is 2 <span class="math"> × </span> 2 <span class="math"> × </span> 3 <span class="math"> × </span> 5.</p>
