<p>For a given conservative dynamical system, the Lagrangian is L=T-V, where T is the kinetic energy of the system and V is its potential energy. L is a function of the generalised coordinates <span class="math"><em>q</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> and generalised velocities <span class="math">$ \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{i}} $</span> of the system.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the equations of motion for a conservative system in this case are <span class="math">$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dt}} \left (
\frac{\partial \mathrm{L}}{\partial \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{j}}} \right )
- \frac{\partial \mathrm{L}}{\partial \mathrm{q}_{\mathrm{j}}} = 0 . $</span></p>
<p>An analogous function can be defined, giving a similar equation of motion, for a non-conservative system.</p>
