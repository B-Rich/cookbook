<p>A number in the sequence obtained when each number is equal to the sum of the two previous ones. The first two terms are 1, 1. The start of the Fibonacci sequence is:</p>
<p>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...</p>
<p>(They were studied by Lam√© before Fibonacci, but the later name of Fibonacci numbers is more often used.)</p>
<p>The <span class="math"><em>n</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> Fibonacci number is given by <br /><span class="math">$$F_n = \frac{ (1 + \sqrt{5} ) ^n - ( 1 - \sqrt{5} ) ^n } { 2^n \sqrt{5} } ,$$</span><br /> or <span class="math"><em>F</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> is the nearest integer to <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} } {2} \right ) .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The only triangular Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 3, 21, 55.</p>
<p>The only square Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 144.</p>
