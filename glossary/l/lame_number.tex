A number in the sequence obtained when each number is equal to
the sum of the two previous ones. The first two
terms are 1, 1.  The start of the
Fibonacci sequence is:
\par
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
\par
(They were studied by Lam\'e before Fibonacci, but the later name
of Fibonacci numbers is more often used.)
\par
The $n^{th}$  Fibonacci number is given by
\[ F_n = \frac{ (1 + \sqrt{5} ) ^n - ( 1 - \sqrt{5} ) ^n } { 2^n \sqrt{5} } , \]
or $F_{n}$  is the nearest integer to 
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} } {2} \right ) . \]
\par
The only triangular Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 3, 21, 55.
\par
The only square Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 144.
