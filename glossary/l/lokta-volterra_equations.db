This is a system of differential equations which can be used
to model the variation of two populations of animals (predators
and prey) over time:
\[ \frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{gx-kxy} \]
\[ \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{ckxy-dy} , \]
\par
where x is the size of the prey population;
\par
y is the size of the predator population;
\par
g is the rate of growth of the prey population (as a fraction of the 
existing population, per unit time);
\par
k is the rate at which the predators kill the prey (kills per predator per
prey animal per unit time);
\par
c represents the number of prey that must be consumed to make a new predator;
\par
is the death rate of the predator (as a proportion of the existing 
population, per unit time).
