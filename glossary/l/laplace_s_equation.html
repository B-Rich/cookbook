<p><br /><span class="math">∇<sup>2</sup>f = 0</span><br /> This is a special case of Poisson’s equation. In two dimensions it is equivalent to: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\partial ^2 \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x} ^2 } 
+ \frac{\partial ^2 \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y} ^2 } =0 .$$</span><br /> Very many common functions are solutions of Laplace’s equation.</p>
