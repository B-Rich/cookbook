<p>For some purposes in astronomy, we assume that the sun and the solar system are moving at a constant velocity of <span class="math">20<em>k</em><em>m</em><em>s</em><sup> − 1</sup></span> towards 18hrs RA, decl. <span class="math">30<sup> ∘ </sup></span>. The frame of reference so defined is called the local standard of rest.</p>
