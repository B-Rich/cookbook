<p>In statistics: the fundamental statistical result that the average of a sequence of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> independent identically distributed random variables tends to their common mean as <span class="math"><em>n</em> → ∞</span> ; thus the relative frequency of an event tends to its probability. See also strong law of large numbers, weak law of large numbers.</p>
