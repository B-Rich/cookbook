A computer language.  
\par
Logo uses instructions such as "forward 40" \texttt{(FD~40)}, "backward 20" \texttt{(BK~20)}, "right 85" \texttt{(RT~85)} or "left 125" \texttt{(LT~125)}, to create drawings. This ability to create graphics, combined with the power of a complete computer language, makes it interesting in mathematics education.
 
\par
Logo is very closely related to LISP - the list processing language used in much early Artificial Intelligence research.
