<p>Two elements g and h of a group G are said to be conjugate if there is an element of G such that <span class="math"><em>g</em> = <em>x</em><em>h</em><em>x</em><sup> − 1</sup>.</span></p>
<p>This is an equivalence relation; so it partitions the group into equivalence classes (called conjugacy classes).</p>
