<p>The 57th uniform polyhedron is the Great stellated dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|2 5/2. Its dual is the great icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5/2,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 7</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 20</p>
<p>Number of edges: 30</p>
<p>Number of faces: 12 (=12<span>5/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
