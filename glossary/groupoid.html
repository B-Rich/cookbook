<p>A set <span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, together with a binary operation <span class="math"> ∼ </span> from <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> to <span class="math"><em>S</em></span>. <span class="math"> ∼ </span> need not be commutative. A groupoid can also be considered as a category with one morphism, in which each element has an inverse under the morphism. Note that an associative groupoid is a semigroup.</p>
