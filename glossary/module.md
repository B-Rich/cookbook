Let R be a ring. A right R-module (or simply a module over R) is an
additive abelian group, M, with a scalar multiplication
!['  M × R arrow M  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2359.1..png)
satisfying:

(a+b)r=ar+br;\
 a(r+p)=ar+ap;\
 a(rp)=(ar)p;\
 a1=a,

where a and b are in M, r and p are in R, and 1 is the identity element
of R.

(Note that if, instead, R were a field, we would have a vector space.)
