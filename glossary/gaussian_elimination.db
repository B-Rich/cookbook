A method for solving systems of n simultaneous linear equations in n unknowns:
\par
Call the equations E(1), E(2), E(3), etc, and write them like this:
\par
E(1): $a_{1,1}x_{1}+a_{1,2}x_{2}+ ... = k_{1}$ 
\par
E(2): $a_{2,1}x_{1}+a_{2,2}x_{2}+ ... = k_{2}$ 
\par
etc...
\par
E(n): $a_{n,1}x_{1}+a_{n,2}x_{2}+ ... = k_{n}$ 
\par
Then multiply E(1) by $a_{2,1}/a_{1,1}$  and subtract it from
E(2); multiply E(1) by $a_{3,1}/a_{1,1}$  and subtract it from E(3),
etc. This will remove $x_{1}$  from all the equations except the first.
\par
Then repeat the procedure with the new set of equations E(2) to E(n); so this removes $x_{2}$  from all the equations except E(2). 
\par
Continue in this way; eventually
we will be left with E(n) from which every variable has been eliminated except $x_{n}, so this equation is automatically solved. So we know x_{n}.$ 
We can substitute this into E(n-1) and find $x_{n-1},$  and so on until we
have found all the unknowns.
\par
Example:
\par
E(1): 3x+4y+2z=10
\par
E(2): x+5y+6z=5
\par
E(3): 2x+y+z=-4
\par
Multiply E(1) by 1/3 to get: x + 4y/3 + 2z/3 = 10/3
\par
Subtract this from E(2) to get: 11y/3 + 16z/3 = 5/3
\par
Multiply E(1) by 2/3 to get: 2x + 8y/3 + 4z/3 = 20/3
\par
Subtract this from E(3) to get: -5y/3 -z/3 = -32/3
\par
Now consider the new set of equations:
\par
E(2): 11y/3 + 16z/3 = 5/3
\par
E(3): -5y/3 -z/3 = -32/3
\par
Tidy this up by multiplying by 3, and multiply E(3) by -1:
\par
E(2): 11y + 16z = 5
\par
E(3): 5y + z = 32
\par
Now multiply E(2) by 5/11 to get 5y + 80z/11 = 25/11
\par
Subtract this from E(3) to get -69z/11 = 227/11
\par
So, z = -227/69
\par
Putting this into E(2) gives y; putting x and y into E(1) gives x.
