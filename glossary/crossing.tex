 Knots are classified by the number of times the 'string' crosses
itself when the knot is projected onto a plane. For any knot
this number of crossings has a smallest possible value, which
is called the number of crossings.
\par
There exists one prime knot with 3 crossings,
\par
one with 4 crossings,
\par
2  with 5 crossings,
\par
3  with 6 crossings,
\par
7  with 7 crossings,
\par
21  with 8 crossings,
\par
49  with 9 crossings,
\par
165  with 10 crossings.
