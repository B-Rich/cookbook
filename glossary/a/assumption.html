<p>At the beginning of a proof, we often decide that certain things are going to be unquestionably true as far as this proof is concerned. These things are called assumptions.</p>
<p>This means that we know in what circumstances the proof works. For instance, two lines meet at a single point, assuming that they are not parallel.</p>
<p>To make a ’proof by contradiction’, we start by assuming something that we think is not true, and see if we can show that the consequences of this are obviously wrong.</p>
