<p>A certain set of paper sizes in common use are called the A-series and designated A4, A3, etc. They are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio <span class="math">$ 1 : \sqrt{2} . $</span> A0 has area <span class="math">1<em>m</em><sup>2</sup>,â€†</span> A1 half of this, A2 a quarter, etc.</p>
<p>So the sizes are:</p>
<p>A0 = 841 x 1189 mm;</p>
<p>A1 = 594 x 841 mm;</p>
<p>A2 = 420 x 594 mm;</p>
<p>A3 = 297 x 420 mm;</p>
<p>A4 = 210 x 297 mm;</p>
<p>A5 = 148 x 210 mm;</p>
<p>A6 = 105 x 148 mm;</p>
<p>A7 = 74 x 105 mm;</p>
<p>A8 = 52 x 74 mm;</p>
<p>A9 = 37 x 52 mm;</p>
<p>A10 = 26 x 37 mm.</p>
<p>Paper size A<em>n</em> has width <span class="math">$2^\frac{-1-2n}{4}$</span>m and height <span class="math">$2^\frac{1-2n}{4}$</span>m; the sizes are rounded down to ensure that two A4 sheets are slightly smaller than one A3 sheet, etc.</p>
