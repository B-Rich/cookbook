<p>Something is ambiguous if it is not clear exactly what it means. For instance:</p>
<p>’Do not think killing the king is good’ could mean either:</p>
<p>’Do not think that it is good to kill the king’</p>
<p>Or: ’Don’t worry about it; killing the king is a good idea’.</p>
<p>In mathematics we try to avoid ambiguity as much as possible, and use special notation, signs and symbols to make things clear.</p>
