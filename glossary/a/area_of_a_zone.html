<p>A spherical zone formed by the intersection of a plane with radius <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> and two parallel planes a distance <span class="math"><em>h</em></span> apart, has area <span class="math">2<em>π</em><em>r</em><em>h</em></span>. Archimedes’ theorem gives us this formula.</p>
