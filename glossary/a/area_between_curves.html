<p>We can use integration to find the area between two curves in the same way that we use it to find the area underneath one curve.</p>
<p>For instance, if we have two functions f(x) and g(x) and we want to find the area between their curves in the region [a, b], and if f(x) is always greater than g(x) in that region, then we would integrate to find the area under the graph of f(x), and then subtract the area under the graph of g(x).</p>
<p>ie, area <span class="math"><em>A</em> = ∫<sub><em>a</em></sub><sup><em>b</em></sup><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>d</em><em>x</em> − ∫<sub><em>a</em></sub><sup><em>b</em></sup><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)<em>d</em><em>x</em>.</span></p>
<p>Care must be taken if the two curves cross, or if one of them crosses the x-axis in the required region.</p>
