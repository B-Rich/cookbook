A number that is the root of some polynomial equation with integer coefficients.
\par
So, for instance, $ \sqrt {5} + 3 $ is an algebraic number because it is a
root of $ \mathrm{x}^2 - 6 \mathrm{x} + 4 = 0, $ but 
$ \pi $ is not, because it cannot be written
as the root of such an equation.
\par
A complex number may be algebraic (for instance i is a root of $1+x^{2}=0).$ 
\par
All rational numbers are algebraic, but not all real or complex numbers are.
\par
If a number is not algebraic, it is transcendental.
