<p>The powers of 2 are sometimes called almost perfect, because the divisors of <span class="math">2<sup><em>n</em></sup><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>m</em><em>t</em><em>o</em>2<sup><em>n</em></sup> − 1.</span> So a power of 2 is deficient, but only just.</p>
<p>It is not known whether there is an odd number n whose divisors (excluding itself) sum to n-1.</p>
