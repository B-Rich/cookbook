<p>A number that is the root of some polynomial equation with integer coefficients.</p>
<p>So, for instance, <span class="math">$ \sqrt {5} + 3 $</span> is an algebraic number because it is a root of <span class="math">x<sup>2</sup> − 6x + 4 = 0, </span> but <span class="math"><em>π</em></span> is not, because it cannot be written as the root of such an equation.</p>
<p>A complex number may be algebraic (for instance i is a root of <span class="math">1 + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 0).</span></p>
<p>All rational numbers are algebraic, but not all real or complex numbers are.</p>
<p>If a number is not algebraic, it is transcendental.</p>
