<p>A curve or a surface which touches every member of a family of lines, curves, planes or surfaces.</p>
<p>A family of curves in two dimensions f(x,y,t)=0 (where t is a parameter) has an envelope whose equation can be found by solving simultaneously:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
  f(x,y,p)&amp;=&amp;0 \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial p } f(x,y,p) &amp;=&amp; 0\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
