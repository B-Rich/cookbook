A random event (eg the throw of a coin) is biased if it is unfair, ie if
all the outcomes are not equally likely. In a survey, a biased sample is
one which may not reflect fairly the whole population. For example,
carrying out a survey about how people get to work by interviewing
people outside a bus station will give a biased sample.
