<p>A topological space <span class="math">(<em>X</em>, <em>τ</em>)</span> is connected if we cannot find open disjoint non-empty subsets <span class="math"><em>U</em>, <em>V</em> ⊆ <em>X</em></span> such that <span class="math"><em>X</em> = <em>U</em> ∪ <em>V</em></span> . Such sets <span class="math"><em>U</em>, <em>V</em></span> would be said to disconnect <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> . Equivalent conditions to connectedness are that every continuous function <span class="math"><em>X</em> ↦ Z</span> is constant, and that the only subsets that are both open and closed are <span class="math">∅</span> and <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> itself. The connected subsets of <span class="math">R</span> are precisely the intervals. Compare Hausdorff space, path connected, polygonally connected.</p>
