The closure of !['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.1..png) ,
written !['   (bar)(A)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.2..png)
is the intersection of all closed sets containing
!['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.3..png) ; a point
!['  b  is a member of  (bar)(A)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.4..png)
iff every neighbourhood of
!['  b  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.5..png) contains points
of !['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.6..png) . The closure
of a set is closed. We say that a set
!['  X\_0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.7..png) is dense in
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.8..png) if
!['   (bar)(X\_0)=X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.9..png) .
This means that any point in
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.10..png) can be
approximated arbitrarily closely by elements of
!['  X\_0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20051.11..png) .
