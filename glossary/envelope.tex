A curve or a surface which touches every member of a family of lines, curves,
planes or surfaces.
\par
A family of curves in two dimensions f(x,y,t)=0 (where t is a 
parameter) has an envelope whose equation can be found by
solving simultaneously:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  f(x,y,p)&=&0 \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial p } f(x,y,p) &=& 0
\end{eqnarray*}
