<p>Given a line segment AB, we construct the perpendicular bisector as follows:</p>
<p>use a pair of compasses to draw two circles with the same radius, centred on A and B;</p>
<p>mark the two places where these circles intersect, C and D;</p>
<p>draw a line through C and D - this is the perpendicular bisector of AB.</p>
