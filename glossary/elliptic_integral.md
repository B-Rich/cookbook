An integral of the form \\

!['  the integral of  f ( x,  the square root of (R) ) dx , '](../dictionary/equation_images/4473.1..png)

where R is a cubic or a quartic in x, and f is a rational functionof its
two arguments.

Any elliptic integral can be written as a sum of multiples of an
elementary function, and the three standard types of elliptic integral.

These integral were first used in finding the circumference of an
ellipse.
