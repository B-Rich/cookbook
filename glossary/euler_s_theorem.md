If n is a natural number, and a is an integer which is coprime to n,
then
!['  a \^(//phi ( n ) ) -1  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3536.1..png)
is divisible by n, where
!['  //phi ( n )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3536.2..png) is
Euler\\'s phi function, giving the number of integers less than n and
coprime to n.
