A polyhedron with twelve plane faces, all of which are identical rhombi.

The particular rhombus which makes this solid has its lengths in ratio
!['   the square root of (2) : 1 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/10027.1..png)
and its angles are approximately 70.5° and 109.5°.

The solid can be constructed by taking a cube, placing an identical cube
on each of its faces, and joining the centres of the new cubes to the
vertices of the original.
