A cofactor of a particular number in a matrix is the determinant of the
matrix formed by removing that number's row, and its column.

For instance: in
!['  (array)( ( 1   2   3 //// 4   5   6 //// 7   8   9 )  ),  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2474.1..png)
the cofactor of 2 is
!['  (array)| ( 4   6 //// 7   9 )  |  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2474.2..png)
= 4 × 9 - 6 × 7 = -6
