 The force on an elastic body is proportional to the ratio of the body's 
extension to its original length;
the constant of proportionality is called the modulus of
elasticity.
\par
It has symbol $ \lambda , $ dimensions $MLT^{-2}$  and
SI unit N, Newton.
\par
It is constant for bodies of a particular material 
with a given cross-section.
