The 10th uniform polyhedron is the Octahedron; it has Wythoff 
symbol 4|2 3. Its dual is the cube. The pattern of polygons 
round each vertex is (3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the 
octahedral group S4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 
2\par
Density: 1\par
Number of vertices: 6\par
Number of edges:  
12\par
Number of faces: 8 (=8 triangles).
\par
Its circumradius is $ \sqrt{2} / 2 $ and
its volume is $ \sqrt{2} / 3  $ if the edge length is 1.
