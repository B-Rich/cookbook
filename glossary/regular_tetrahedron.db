The 6th uniform polyhedron is the Tetrahedron; it has Wythoff 
symbol 3|2 3. Its dual is the tetrahedron. The pattern of polygons 
round each vertex is (3,3,3); its symmetry group is the tetrahedral 
group A4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 1\par
Number 
of vertices: 4\par
Number of edges:  6\par
Number of faces: 4 (=4 triangles).
\par
Its circumradius is $ \sqrt{6} / 4 $
and its volume is $ \sqrt {2} / 12   $ if the edge length is 1.
