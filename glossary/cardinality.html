<p>The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. For finite sets this is always a natural number.</p>
<p>Countable infinite sets have cardinality <span class="math">ℵ<sub>0</sub></span> (’aleph-null’); the set of real numbers has cardinality <span class="math">ℵ<sub>1</sub>.</span></p>
<p>The cardinality of a set A can be written n(A), |A|, or <span class="math">$ \bar{\mathrm{A}}. $</span></p>
