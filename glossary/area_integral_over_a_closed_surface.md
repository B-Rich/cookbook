The integral of vector area over the whole of a closed surface is zero:
\\
!['  the integral of  \_(S) dS =  the integral of  \_(S) dS n = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/3474.1..png)
where S is a closed surface and **n** is the normal to that surface at
any point; dS is scalar area and **dS** is vector area.
