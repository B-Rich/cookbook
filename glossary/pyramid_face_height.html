<p>The face height of a pyramid is the distance from the apex to the centre of one of the base’s edges.</p>
<p>A pyramid whose base is a regular n-gon with side length x and whose apex is directly above the centre of the base, has face height f.</p>
<p>to find f, note that the short radius of a regular n-gon is <span class="math">$ r = \frac{x \tan \theta }{2} , $</span> where <span class="math">$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} . $</span> Then we have <span class="math"><em>f</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>h</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> where h is the height of the pyramid.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">$ f = \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{x^2 \tan ^2 \theta }{4} } . $</span></p>
