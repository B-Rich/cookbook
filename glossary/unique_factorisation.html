<p>The unique factorisation of a number is the way of writing that number as a product of prime numbers and powers of prime numbers, in ascending order. For instance, the unique factorisation of 360 is <span class="math">2<sup>3</sup> × 3<sup>2</sup> × 5.</span> It is called unique because, for a given number, there is always only one way of doing this.</p>
