<p>This is a test of the null hypothesis that the population variance is <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>.</span> We have a sample of size n and we compute an unbiased estimate of the population variance <span class="math"><em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span> using divisor n-1. The distribution used is <span class="math"><em>χ</em><sup>2</sup></span> with n-1 degrees of freedom; the test statistic is <span class="math">$ \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma ^2 } . $</span></p>
<p>We assume that the population is normal.</p>
