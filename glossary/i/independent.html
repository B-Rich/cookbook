<p>Two variables are independent if one can be varied without affecting the other.</p>
<p>Two events are independent if the probability distribution of one is not affected by the result of the other one.</p>
<p>E.g. When you throw a dice, the score you get on your second throw is not affected by whatever score you got on the first throw.</p>
