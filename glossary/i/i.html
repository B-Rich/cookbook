<p>The first imaginary number; it is defined by saying that <span class="math"><em>i</em><sup>2</sup> =  − 1</span>. Note that because <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> does not lie on the real number line, it is neither greater than nor less than 1. <span class="math"><em>i⃗</em></span> is also used to denote the unit vector in the x direction: <span class="math">$
x = \left( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  1 \\ 0 
\end{array} 
\right ) $</span> in two dimensions or <span class="math">$ x = \left ( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0 
\end{array}
\right ) $</span> in three dimensions. Capital I is used to denote the identity mapping, or the identity matrix.</p>
