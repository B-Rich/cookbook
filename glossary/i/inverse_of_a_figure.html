<p>Given a circle, which is called the circle of inversion and has radius r and centre O, the inverse of a point A is the point B on OA such that <span class="math"><em>O</em><em>A</em>.<em>O</em><em>B</em> = <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>.</span> In three dimensions a sphere of inversion is used.</p>
<p>This transformation leaves unchanged the circle of inversion, any circle orthogonal to it, and straight lines through O. It also leaves angles unchanged. Other circles and lines are all turned into circles by inversion.</p>
