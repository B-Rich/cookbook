The 49th uniform polyhedron is the Icosidodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 5|3. Its dual is the medial icosacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,5/3,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -16\par
Density: 4\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 44 (=20 hexagons and 12 pentagons and 12{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
