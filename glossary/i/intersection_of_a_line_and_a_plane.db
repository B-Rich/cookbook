A line and a plane which are not parallel intersect in a point.
\par
If the equations of the line are $x=pz+d$, $y=qz+e$, and the
equation of the plane is $z=mx+ny+c$, then the point of intersection
is at:
\begin{eqnarray*}
x&=&\frac{d-nqd+nep+cp}{1-mp-nq}\\
y&=&\frac{e-mpe+mdq+cq}{1-mp-nq}\\
z&=&\frac{md+ne+c}{1-mp-nq}.
\end{eqnarray*}
