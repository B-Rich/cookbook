<p>Two groups are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them, i.e. a bijective map which preserves the groupsâ€™ multiplication table completely.</p>
<p>In other words, G and H are isomorphic if there exists a bijective function f from G to H with the property that: for all p and q in G, f(pq)=f(p)f(q).</p>
<p>Groups which are isomorphic are the same for most practical purposes.</p>
