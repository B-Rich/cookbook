This is a special case of the Normal test for difference in means.

Given two distributions with variances
!['  //sigma \_1 \^2 , //sigma \_2 \^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1837.2..png)
this is a test of the null hypothesis that their means are equal. We
have two samples x~i~ and y~i~ of sizes m and n. The distribution used
is N(0,1); the test statistic is \\

![' ( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) )/  (  the square root of  (
(//sigma \_1 \^2 )/(m) + (//sigma \_1 \^2)/(n) ) ) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/1837.1..png)

If the two distributions are not normal, or if the variances have to be
estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be taken.
