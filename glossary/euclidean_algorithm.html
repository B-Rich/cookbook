<p>A way of finding the highest common factor of two different numbers:</p>
<p>1) Divide the larger number by the smaller.</p>
<p>2) If the division can be done exactly then the HCF is the smaller number. If there is a remainder then the HCF is the same as the HCF of the remainder and the smaller number - so repeat step 1 with these two numbers.</p>
<p>For instance, to find HCF(17, 20):</p>
<p>20/17 = 1, with remainder 3</p>
<p>so the HCF is the same as HCF(17, 3):</p>
<p>17/3 = 6 with remainder 1</p>
<p>so the HCF is the same as HCF(3, 1):</p>
<p>3/1 = 3; this is exact, so the HCF is 1.</p>
