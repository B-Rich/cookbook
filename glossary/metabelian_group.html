<p>A group G is called a metabelian group if <span class="math">G<sup>′</sup> ⊆ Z(G)</span> where <span class="math">G<sup>′</sup></span> is the group generated by all commutators <span class="math">[<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>] = <em>x</em><sup> − 1</sup><em>y</em><sup> − 1</sup><em>x</em><em>y</em></span> of G ( <span class="math">G<sup>′</sup></span> is called the commutator subgroup of G), and Z(G) is the centre of G, i.e. the group containing those elements of G which each commute with every element of G.</p>
