A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger
than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper,
bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.

The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, ie
!['  1 :  the square root of (2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4158.1..png)
and SRA0 size has area 1.15m^2^, SRA1 half this, etc. So the sizes are:

SRA0= 900 × 1280 mm;\
 SRA1= 640 × 900 mm;\
 SRA2= 450 × 640 mm;\
 SRA3= 320 × 450 mm;\
 SRA4= 225 × 320 mm.

The sizes are rounded to the nearest centimetre.
