<p>If A is a matrix representing a linear map, then given any polynomial p, p(A) is also a matrix representing a linear map.</p>
<p>We call a polynomial p a minimal polynomial for A if:</p>
<p>p(A)=0;</p>
<p>the degree of p is smaller than or equal to that of any other polynomial q that has q(A)=0;</p>
<p>the leading coefficient of p is 1; is p is monic.</p>
<p>It can be shown that there is precisely one minimal polynomial for A.</p>
