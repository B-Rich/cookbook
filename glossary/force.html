<p>An influence that causes an object to accelerate. The size of the acceleration is proportional to the size of the force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object; this is Newton’s second law of motion.</p>
<p>Force is a vector quantity; its size is measured in Newtons. One Newton will make a body of mass 1kg accelerate from rest to 1 metre per second, in a time of one second.</p>
<p>Force has dimensions <span class="math"><em>M</em><em>L</em><em>T</em><sup> − 2</sup>.</span> The Newton is the SI unit of force.</p>
