An element of geometry that has only one dimension, its length. It has
no breadth or width and is often thought of as a set of points that are
so very closely set down there are no gaps between them.

A line segment is usually part of a straight line between two given
points on it. There are many different types of line segment. They can
be diagonal, horizontal, vertical, oblique, parallel, perpendicular.

When a line segment is not straight it is often called an arc.

A line of symmetry is a line segment which can be used to divide a shape
into two equal and matching parts, with one half folding over and
fitting exactly on top of the other half.

A line graph is a graph whose plotted points are joined by lines
