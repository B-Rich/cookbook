A group G is called a metabelian group if
!['  G '  is a proper subset of eq Z(G)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3627.1..png)
where !['  G '  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3627.2..png) is the
group generated by all commutators [x,y]=x^-1^y^-1^xy of G (
!['  G '  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3627.3..png) is called the
commutator subgroup of G), and Z(G) is the centre of G, ie the group
containing those elements of G which each commute with every element of
G.
