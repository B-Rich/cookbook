28 is a happy number because:
\par
$28 \rightarrow 2^2 + 8^2 =  4 + 64 = 68$   
\par
$68 \rightarrow 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$
\par
$100 \rightarrow 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$
\par
Twenty eight can be reduced to 1 by the process of repeatedly squaring and adding 
the digits.
Thirty two is also a happy number:
\par
$32 \rightarrow 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13$
\par
$13 \rightarrow 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$
\par
$10 \rightarrow 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1$
\par
	But  24 is a sad, unhappy number. Can you see why?
