The act of combining elements of a set.

\par
Multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting are specific operations used 
on the set of numbers.  Two numbers can be combined using one of these operations  
to produce a third number.  
\par
Using the numbers 8 and 2:
\par
multiplying them produces 16; 
\par
dividing them produces 4(or a quarter); 
\par
adding them produces 10; 
\par
while subtracting them produces 6 (or -6, negative six).

The order of doing operations on numbers is very important.
