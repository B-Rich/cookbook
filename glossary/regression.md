Regression is a model which describes one random variable as being
dependent one one or more others. Often the relationship between the
variables is a straight-line one, which is called a linear regression.

If we have a random variable X and another variable p, then if we
express the mean of X conditional up on p as a function of p:
!['  (E) ( X | p ) = f(p)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2932.1..png)
then this is called the regression of X on p.
