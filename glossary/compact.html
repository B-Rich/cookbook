<p>A topological space is compact if every open cover of the entire space has a finite subcover. For example, <span class="math">[<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>]</span> is compact in <span class="math">R</span> (the Heine-Borel theorem). The continuous image of a compact set is compact, as is a closed subset of a compact set. Moreover, there is a partial converse in that every compact set of a Hausdorff space is closed. The compact subsets of <span class="math">R<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> are precisely the closed and bounded subsets. For subsets <span class="math"><em>X</em> ⊆ R<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> , <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> is compact iff it is sequentially compact iff it is closed and bounded. See also totally bounded.</p>
