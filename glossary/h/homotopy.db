  
Let  $  \varphi  : [a,b] \to D $  and  $  \psi  : [a,b] \to D $  be piecewise smooth
closed paths in a domain  $ D $ . A homotopy from  $  \varphi  $ 
to  $  \psi  $  is a continuous function  $  \gamma  : [a,b]^2 to D $  satisfying
 
   \par
  $  \gamma(a,t) =  \varphi (t)   \forall t \in[a,b] $ ,
   \par
  $  \gamma(b,t) =  \psi    (t)   \forall t \in[a,b] $ ,
   \par
  $  \forall s \in[a,b] $ , the path  $  \gamma _s(t)= \gamma (s,t) $  is closed and piecewise smooth.
 
More generally, we may drop the closedness conditions.

A closed path is  contractible if it is  homotopic (i.e. 
there is a homotopy) to a constant path. A domain  $ D $  is
 simply connected if every closed path is contractible.
