David Hilbert (1862-1943): A German mathematician. 
\par
He worked on invariant theory and algebraic number theory, and made enormous 
contributions to the modern study of geometry. He was influential in founding
the axiomatic approach to mathematics.
\par
He proposed a famous list of 23 unsolved problems, challenging mathematicians
to confront fundamental difficulties. Many of these have been solved in the 20th
century, and the attempts to solve them have always contributed to the progress
of mathematics.
\par
Later in his life he worked on integral equations, the calculus of variations, and philosophy of mathematics.
The Hilbert space is named after him.
