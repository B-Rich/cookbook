An elastic body under tension obeys the law that the force
exerted is proportional to the extension of the body: 
$T=kx$, where $T$ is the tension, $x$ the extension and $k$ the stiffness
of the body.
\par
Alternatively, the force exerted is proportional the
the proportional extension of the body:
\par
$ T = \lambda \frac{x}{l_0} , $ where $T$ is the tension,
$x$ the extension, $l_{0}$  the initial length
and $ \lambda $ the modulus of elasticity.
