<p>A mapping between two sets, which preserves the algebraic structure of the domain set. i.e. if a particular algebraic relation is true in the domain, it will be true after the mapping has been applied, in the range.</p>
<p>A homomorphism between groups G and H is a map f that preserves the group operation, i.e. if p, q are in G then f(pq)=f(p)f(q).</p>
<p>(Do not confuse this with homeomorphism.)</p>
