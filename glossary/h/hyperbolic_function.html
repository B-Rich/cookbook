<p>A group of functions related to the trigonometric functions:</p>
<p>hyperbolic sin of x is written sinh(x) (pronounced ’shine x’)</p>
<p>hyperbolic cos of x is written cosh(x) (’cosh x’)</p>
<p>hyperbolic tan of x is written tanh(x) (’tansh x’)</p>
<p>Definitions; sinh(x) = [exp(x) - exp(-x)]/2</p>
<p>cosh(x) = [exp(x) + exp(-x)]/2</p>
<p>tanh(x) = sinh(x)/cosh(x)</p>
<p>There are also sech, coth and cosech, defined as 1/cosh, 1/sinh and 1/tanh respectively.</p>
