<p>A one-sided surface whose faces are four triangles and three quadrilaterals. It is possible to make a regular heptahedron with equilateral triangles and squares, though as the surface encloses no volume it is not clear whether or not it should be considered a polyhedron.</p>
<p>It can be formed from alternate faces of an octahedron, together with the octahedronâ€™s three quadrilateral cross-sections.</p>
