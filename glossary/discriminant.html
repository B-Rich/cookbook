<p>An expression derived from an equation, which gives us some information about the solutions of the equation.</p>
<p>For instance, the discriminant for a quadratic equation: <span class="math"><em>a</em><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> + bx + c = 0 is:</p>
<p>d = <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup>2</sup></span> - 4ac.</p>
<p>If d is positive, the equation has two solutions; if d = 0 there is one solution and if d is negative there are no real solutions.</p>
