A discrete distribution, written B(n, p) and given by: \\

![' P(r) =   (  (n //////// r)  )   p\^(r)  (1-p)\^(n-r)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2603.1..png)

where
!['   (  (n //////// r)  )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2603.2..png)
is a binomial coefficient.

It is the distribution of the number of successes out of n independent
Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success.

It has mean np and variance npq.

It has PGF G(t)=(q+pt)^n^.

As n becomes very large, the distribution becomes narrower, forming a
peak around X=pn (ie on average, a proportion p of the trials will be
successful).
