This is a system of differential equations which can be used to model
the variation of two populations of animals (predators and prey) over
time: \\

![' (dx)/(dt) = gx-kxy '](../dictionary/equation_images/10092.1..png)

\\

![' (dy)/(dt) = ckxy-dy , '](../dictionary/equation_images/10092.2..png)

where x is the size of the prey population;\
 y is the size of the predator population;\
 g is the rate of growth of the prey population (as a fraction of the
existing population, per unit time);\
 k is the rate at which the predators kill the prey (kills per predator
per prey animal per unit time);\
 c represents the number of prey that must be consumed to make a new
predator;\
 is the death rate of the predator (as a proportion of the existing
population, per unit time).
