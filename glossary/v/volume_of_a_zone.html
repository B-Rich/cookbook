<p>If a spherical zone is formed by the intersection of a sphere with centre O and radius r, and two planes at z=a and z=b, then the volume of the zone is <span class="math">$ \frac{\pi}{3} ( {b} ( 3 {R} ^2 - {b}^2 ) 
- {b} ( 3 {R} ^2 - {a} ^2 ) ) . $</span></p>
<p>(NB that this is only true if |a|,|b|&lt;R.</p>
<p>In the case of a zone of one base we have a=R so <span class="math">$ {V} =
\frac{\pi}{3} ( {a} ^3 - 3 {R} ^2 {a} + 2 {R} ^2 ) . $</span></p>
