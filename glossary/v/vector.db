In elementary maths, a vector is 
a quantity which has both size and direction.
For instance the wind might be measured by a 
vector, since it has both speed and direction.

Sometimes it is helpful to think of a vector
as a directed line segment.

At a higher level we define a vector as a
member of a set of objects which obeys the rules of
vector algebra - i.e. a member of a vector space.
