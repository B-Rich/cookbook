<p>A plane containing the point ǎ and having direction vectors b and č has equation <span class="math"><strong>x</strong> = <strong>a</strong> + <em>t</em><strong>b</strong> + <em>u</em><strong>c</strong></span>, where <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>u</em></span> may be any real numbers.</p>
<p>Note that b and č must not be parallel to one another.</p>
<p>Alternatively: given a point <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> with position vector ǎ and a normal vector ň, the plane perpendicular to ň through ǎ has vector equation <span class="math">(<strong>r</strong> − <strong>a</strong>).<strong>n</strong> = 0</span>.</p>
