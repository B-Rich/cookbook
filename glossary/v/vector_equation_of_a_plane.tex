\newcommand{\v}[1]{$\mathbf{#1}$}
\newcommand{\b}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
A plane containing the point \v{a} and having direction vectors \v{b} and \v{c} has equation $\b{x}=\b{a}+t\b{b}+u\b{c}$, where $t$ and $u$ may be any real numbers.
\par
Note that \v{b} and \v{c} must not be parallel to one another.
\par
Alternatively: given a point $A$ with position vector \v{a} and a normal vector \v{n}, the plane perpendicular to \v{n} through \v{a} has vector equation $(\b{r}-\b{a}).\b{n} = 0$.
