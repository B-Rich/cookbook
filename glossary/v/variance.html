<p>A measure of spread of a distribution. It is equal to the mean of the squared distance of the variable from its mean: <br /><span class="math">$$\mathrm{Var(x)} = 
\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}} \sum _{\mathrm{x}} ( \mathrm{x} - \bar{\mathrm{x}} ) ^2 ,$$</span><br /> where n is the number of possible values of x, and <span class="math">$ \bar{\mathrm{x}} $</span> means the mean of x.</p>
<p>It is often written <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> where <span class="math"><em>σ</em></span> is the standard deviation.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the variance of X is equal to <span class="math">$ \bar{(\mathrm{x}^2)} - ( \bar{\mathrm{x}})^2 , $</span> where <span class="math">$ \bar{(\mathrm{x}^2)} $</span> means the mean of <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
