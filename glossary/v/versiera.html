<p>Take a circle with a diameter PQ, and draw a tangent to the circle at Q. Pick a point R on the circle, and extend the line PR to intersect the tangent. Call this intersection S. Draw a line parallel to PQ through S, and one parallel to the tangent through R. The intersection of these last two lines is called P’. The locus of P’ as R moves around the circle, is called a versiera or witch of Agnesi.</p>
<p>The curve has an equation of the form: <span class="math"><em>x</em><em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 4<em>a</em><sup>2</sup>(2<em>a</em> − <em>x</em>), </span> where a is the radius of the circle.</p>
