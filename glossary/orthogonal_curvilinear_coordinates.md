A coordinate system for
!['  n  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20237.1..png) -dimensional
space defined by specifying
!['  n  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20237.2..png) orthogonal
vectors, which are in general functions of position. Given these
vectors, the components of a given point are the calculated in the usual
manner. Common examples are Cartesian coordinates, cylindrical polar
coordinates and spherical polar coordinates.
