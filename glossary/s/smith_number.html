<p>If n is composite, and the sum of the digits in its prime factorisation is equal to the sum of the digits in n, then n is a Smith number. Eg <span class="math">4937775 = 3 × 5 × 5 × 65837, </span> and 4+9+3+7+7+7+5=3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7=42. It is not known whether there are finitely or infinitely many Smith numbers.</p>
