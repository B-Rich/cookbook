The 35th uniform polyhedron is the Small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|5/2 3. Its dual is the small triambic icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,3,5/2,3,5/2,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
Density: 2\par
Number of vertices: 20\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 32 (=20 triangles and 12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
