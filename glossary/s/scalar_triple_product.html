<p>The scalar triple product of three vectors A, B and C is A.(B <span class="math"> × </span> C), which is a scalar. It is equal to |A||B||C|sin(t)cos(a), where t is the angle between B and C and a is the angle between B <span class="math"> × </span> C and A.</p>
<p>It is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped of which A, B and C are three edges.</p>
