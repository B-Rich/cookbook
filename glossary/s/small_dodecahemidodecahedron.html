<p>The 56th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecahemidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|5. Its dual is the small dodecahemidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,5/4,10,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -12</p>
<p>It is one-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 30</p>
<p>Number of edges: 60</p>
<p>Number of faces: 18 (=6<span>10</span>and 6 pentagons and 6<span>5/4</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
