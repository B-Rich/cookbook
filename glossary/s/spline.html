<p>If we have a set of data points <span class="math">(<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>), </span> and we are trying to fit a curve to them , one way to do this is to fit a polynomial curve between each consecutive pair of points, in such a way that the two polynomial curves meeting at any point have the same gradient at that point.</p>
<p>The curve made up of these polynomial curves is called a spline.</p>
