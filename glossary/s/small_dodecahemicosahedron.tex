The 67th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecahemicosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 5/2|3. Its dual is the small dodecahemicosacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,5/3,6,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
It is one-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 30\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 22 (=10 hexagons and 6{5/2}and 6{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
