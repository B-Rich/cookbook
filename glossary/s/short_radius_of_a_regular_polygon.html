<p>A regular n-gon of side length x has short radius r. To find r, consider the triangle OAX, where O is the centre, A one vertex and X the centre of a side next to A. We know that the interior angle of a regular n-gon is <span class="math">$ 180 - \frac{360}{n}, $</span> so angle OAX= <span class="math">$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} , $</span> and we have <span class="math">$ \tan \theta = \frac{r}{x/2} . $</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math">$ r = \frac{x \tan \theta }{2} . $</span></p>
