The 37th uniform polyhedron is the Small snub icosicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |5/2 3 3. Its dual is the small hexagonal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,5/2,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
Density: 2\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  180\par
Number of faces: 112 (=100 triangles and 12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
