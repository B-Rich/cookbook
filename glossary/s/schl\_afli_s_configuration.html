<p>A line <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>, with five skew lines <span class="math"><em>V</em>, <em>W</em>, <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em></span> which cut <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>, and the five unique lines (apart from <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>) each of which cuts four of <span class="math"><em>V</em>, <em>W</em>, <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em>, <em>Z</em></span>; and the unique line cutting all of these latter five lines. This configuration of 12 lines and 30 points, with 2 lines through each point and 5 points on each line, is called Schläfli’s configuration.</p>
