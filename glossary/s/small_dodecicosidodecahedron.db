The 38th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 5|5. Its dual is the small dodecacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,3/2,10,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -16\par
Density: 2\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 44 (=12{10}and 12 pentagons and 20{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
