The 24th uniform polyhedron is the Stellated truncated hexahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 3|4/3. Its dual is the great triakisoctahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,8/3,3); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 7\par
Number of vertices: 24\par
Number of edges:  36\par
Number of faces: 14 (=8 triangles and 6{8/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
