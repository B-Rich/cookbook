A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger than 
the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper, bind it and
then trim it down to standard A- sizes.
\par
The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, i.e. $ 1 : \sqrt{2} , $
and SRA0 size has area $1.15m^{2},$  SRA1 half this, etc. So the sizes are:
\par
SRA0= 900 \ensuremath{ \times } 1280  mm;
\par
SRA1= 640 \ensuremath{ \times } 900  mm;
\par
SRA2= 450 \ensuremath{ \times } 640  mm;
\par
SRA3= 320 \ensuremath{ \times } 450 mm;
\par
SRA4= 225 \ensuremath{ \times } 320 mm.
\par
The sizes are rounded to the nearest centimetre.
