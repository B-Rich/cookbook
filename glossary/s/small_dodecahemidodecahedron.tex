The 56th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecahemidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|5. Its dual is the small dodecahemidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,5/4,10,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -12\par
It is one-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 30\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 18 (=6{10}and 6 pentagons and 6{5/4}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
