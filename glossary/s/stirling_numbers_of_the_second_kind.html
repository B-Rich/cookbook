<p>If we have a set of n elements, and we want to partition it into k subsets each with at least one element, the number of ways to do this is called the Stirling number of the second kind, <span class="math">S<sub>n</sub><sup>(k)</sup></span> or <span class="math">$ \left \{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
  \mathrm{n} \\
  \mathrm{k}
\end{array} 
\right \} . $</span></p>
<p>For example if we have the set <span>1,2,3,4</span> we can partition it into two subsets in the following ways:</p>
<p><span><span>1</span>,<span>2,3,4</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2</span>,<span>1,3,4</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3</span>,<span>1,2,4</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4</span>,<span>1,2,3</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1,2</span>,<span>3,4</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1,3</span>,<span>2,4</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1,4</span>,<span>2,3</span></span></p>
<p>So <span class="math">S<sub>4</sub><sup>(2)</sup> = 7.</span></p>
