<p>A continuous distribution - a special case of the Normal distribution - denoted N(0,1), defined by <br /><span class="math">$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp 
\left ( - \frac{1}{2} x ^2 \right ) .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>It has mean 0 and variance 1.</p>
<p>It has MGF <br /><span class="math">$$M( \theta ) = \exp ( \frac{1}{2}  \theta ^2 ) .$$</span><br /></p>
