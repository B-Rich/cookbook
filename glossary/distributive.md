Consider the sum 5×(3+6). One way of calculating it could be 5×9,
working out the brackets first, giving the answer 45.

Another way of calculating it could be (5×3)+(5×6) i.e multiplying
everything inside the brackets by 5, which gives 15+30, an answer of 45.

Both ways give the same answer because multiplication is distributive
over addition.
