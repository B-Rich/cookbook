A force that can be written as the gradient of a potential, ie
!['  f(x) = - //nabla //phi ( x )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3472.1..png)
for some
!['  //phi ( x ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3472.2..png) The
minus sign is conventionally used because it allows us to consider
!['  //phi ( x )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3472.3..png) as the
potential energy of the field at x.
