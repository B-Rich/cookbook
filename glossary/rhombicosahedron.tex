The 61st uniform polyhedron is the Rhombicosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2 3|. Its dual is the rhombicosacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,4,6/5,4/3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -10\par
It is one-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 50 (=10 hexagons and 15 quadrilaterals and 15{4/3}and 10{6/5}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
