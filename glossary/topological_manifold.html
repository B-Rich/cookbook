<p>A topological manifold of dimension <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> is a topological space <span class="math"><em>M</em><sup><em>m</em></sup></span> which is Hausdorff and second countable, and is also locally homeomorphic to <span class="math">R<sup><em>m</em></sup></span> . This means that every point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic with an open subset of <span class="math">R<sup><em>m</em></sup></span> .</p>
