The 52nd uniform polyhedron is the Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2|3 5. Its dual is the great triambic icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,5,3,5,3,5)/2; its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
Density: 6\par
Number of vertices: 20\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 32 (=12 pentagons and 20 triangles).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
