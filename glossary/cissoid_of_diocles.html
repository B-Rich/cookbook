<p>A special case of a cissoid; given a circle, a diameter AB of the circle, and the tangent to the circle at A, a cissoid of Diocles is the cissoid of the circle and the tangent with respect to B.</p>
<p>It has polar equation <span class="math"><em>r</em> = 2<em>a</em>(sec<em>θ</em> − cos<em>θ</em>).</span></p>
<p>This curve is the inverse of a parabola with respect to its vertex.</p>
