A prime number which can be written in the form $2^{n}-1$  is called a 
Mersenne prime. The Mersenne number $M_{n}$  is prime for many values of n,
for instance n=2, 3, 5, 7, 13.
\par
It is necessary for n to be prime, but not every prime number $n$ leads to a Mersenne prime $2^{n}-1;$  for instance $n=11$ does 
not give a Mersenne prime. The first few are:
\par $2^{2}-1  = 3$,
\par $2^{3}-1  = 7$,
\par $2^{5}-1  = 31$,
\par $2^{7}-1  = 127$,
\par $2^{13}-1  = 8191$,

Note that if $2^{n}-1$ is prime, then $2^{p-1}(2^{p}-1)$  is a perfect number.
