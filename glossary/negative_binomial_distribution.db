 A discrete distribution defined by
\par $$P(X=r)=^{r-1}C_{n-1}q^{r-n}p^{n},$$  
r=n, n+1, ..., p in (0,1), q=1-p.
\par
It has mean n/p and variance $nq/p^{2}.$ 
\par
It describes the number of trials needed to obtain n successes in
a binomial process. The special case n=1 is the geometric distribution.
\par
It has PGF $[pt/(1-qt)]^{n}.$
