<p>Of a metric space : having the property that, given <span class="math"><em>ɛ</em> &gt; 0</span> , we can find finitely many open balls of radius <span class="math"><em>ɛ</em></span> that cover the space. In a complete metric space this is equivalent to saying that the space is sequentially compact or just compact.</p>
