If a point P moves on the surface of a sphere in such a way that
!['  //phi / //theta  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3370.1..png) is
constant - where
!['  //phi (   and ) //theta  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3370.2..png)
are the longitude and colatitude (the angular distance from a pole),
then the locus of P is a clelia.
