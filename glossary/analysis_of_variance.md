A test of the null hypothesis that k samples are taken from populations
with the same mean. The populations are assumed to be normal and have a
common unknown variance.

The distribution used is F with parameters k-1, n-k, where n is the
total sample size. The test statistic is \\

![' ( ( ( the sum of  \_i n\_i ( (bar)(x\_i) - (bar)(x) ) \^2)/(k-1)  ) )/  ( (  ( the sum of  \_i  the sum of  \_j ( x\_(ij) - (bar)(x\_i) ) \^2)/(n-k)  ) ) , '](../dictionary/equation_images/3041.1..png)

where !['  x\_(ij)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3041.2..png) is the
jth element of sample i,
!['  (bar)(x\_i)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3041.3..png) is the
mean of sample i,
!['  n\_i  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3041.4..png) is the size of
sample i and
!['  (bar)(x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3041.5..png) is the mean
taken over all samples.
