A test of the null hypothesis that the population mean has value
!['  //mu .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1819.1..png) The
distribution used is the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom,
where n is the sample size; tables are given for this distribution. The
test statistic is !['  ( (bar)(x) - //mu )/( s /  the square root of (n)
)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1819.2..png) where s is an unbiased
estimate of the population standard deviation, ie calculated using
divisor n-1. This test assumes that X is normally distributed.
