August Möbius (1790-1868) was a German mathematician, now remembered mainly for the
Möbius strip which is named after him. He worked in astronomy as well as
trigonometrical equations, geometry and projective geometry. The 
Möbius transformation is named after him.

He was interested in topology, and worked on questions to do with map-colouring,
although the Möbius strip was in fact discovered by a mathematician named Listing.
