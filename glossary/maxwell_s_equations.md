These are the equations which govern the behaviour of electrical and
magnetic fields: \\

![' //nabla . B = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.1..png)

\\

![' //nabla × E + (d(partial) B)/(d(partial) t) = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.2..png)

\\

![' //nabla . D = //rho '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.3..png)

\\

![' //nabla × H - (d(partial) D)/(d(partial) t) =   J '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.4..png)

(Factors of c, etc, may arise in the equations depending on the system
of units. The above are for MKSA units.)

E is the electric field,
!['  D = //epsilon\_(0) E + P  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.5..png)
is the displacement where
!['  //epsilon\_(0)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.6..png) is
the permittivity of free space and P is the polarisation.

B is the magnetic induction or flux density, !['  H = (B)/(//mu  \_(0)
) - M  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.7..png) is the magnetic
field where
!['  //mu \_(0)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.8..png) is the
permeability if free space and M is the magnetisation.

!['  //rho  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.9..png) is the
electric charge density, J is the current density.

In a linear isotropic medium P=M=0, and
!['  //epsilon  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.10..png) and
!['  //mu  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.11..png) are constants,
but in general H and D will depend on the earlier behaviour of the
system.

Note also that !['  (1)/(//epsilon\_(0) //mu\_(0)
) = c\^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4406.12..png) where c is the
speed of light in a vacuum.
