<p>This is a test of the null hypothesis that two samples drawn from similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the <em>same</em> distribution, against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different locations.</p>
<p>The sample statistic is <span class="math"><em>T</em> = <em>W</em> − <em>m</em>(<em>m</em> + 1)/2</span>, where <span class="math"><em>W</em></span> is the sum of ranks of the smaller sample, and <span class="math"><em>m</em></span> is the size of this sample. Tables are given for use with this test.</p>
