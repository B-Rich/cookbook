If we have a set of n objects, and we want to turn this into
a set of k lists where the order of elements in a list matters,
but cyclic permutations do not (ie each list is a cycle) - then
the number of ways to do this is called the Stirling number of
the first kind s(n,k).
\par
Eg if we have the set {1,2,3,4} we can turn it into the following
sets of 3 cycles:
\par
{{1,3,2},{4}}
\par
{{1,2,3},{4}} 
\par
{{1,4,2},{3}} 
\par
{{1,4,2},{3}} 
\par
{{1,2,4},{3}} 
\par
{{1,2},{3,4}} 
\par
{{1,4,3},{2}}
\par
{{1,3,4},{2}} 
\par
{{1,3},{2,4}} 
\par
{{1,4},{2,3}} 
\par
{{1},{2,4,3}} 
\par
{{1},{2,3,4}} 
\par
So s(4,2)=11.
