David Hilbert (1862-1943): A Prussian mathematician.

He worked on invariant theory and algebraic number theory, and made
enormous contributions to the modern study of geometry. He was
influential in founding the axiomatic approach to mathematics.

He proposed a famous list of 23 unsolved problems, challenging
mathematicians to confront fundamental difficulties. Many of these have
been solved in the 20th century, and the attempts to solve them have
always contributed to the progress of mathematics.

Later in his life he worked on integral equations, and the calculus of
variations. The Hilbert space is named after him.
