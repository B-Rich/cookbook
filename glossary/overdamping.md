A damped harmonic system
!['  (d\^2 x)/(dt\^2) + //alpha (dx)/(dt)   + //omega \^2 x = 0   '](../dictionary/equation_images/2098.1..png)
is described as overdamped if
!['  //alpha \> 2 //omega .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2098.2..png)

In this case the equation is solved by
!['  x = A e \^(mt) + B e \^(nt)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2098.3..png)
where m and n are the roots of the auxiliary equation.

The system does not oscillate at all; it simply returns to the
equilibrium position and stays there.
