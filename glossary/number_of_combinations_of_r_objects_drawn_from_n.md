If we have n objects, and we choose r of them, but the order in which we
choose them does not matter, the number of ways of doing this is ^n^C~r~
or !['   (  ( n) (r)  )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3413.1..png)
ie !['   (n!)/(
(n-r)!r!) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3413.2..png)

This is because the number of ways of choosing r objects from n is equal
to the number of ways of permuting r objects from n, divided by the
number or ways of permuting r objects. This is ^n^P~r~/r! ie
!['   (n!)/( (n-r)!r!) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3413.3..png)
