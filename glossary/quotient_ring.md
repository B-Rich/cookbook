A ring of the form \\
![' R/I= (a+I | a  is a member of  R ), '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.1..png)
where !['  R  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.2..png) is a given
ring and !['  I  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.3..png) is ideal
in !['  R  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.4..png) .
Multiplication is defined as
!['  (a+I)(b+I)  |-\>  (ab+I)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.5..png)
and it is for this reason that we need
!['  I  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.6..png) to be ideal in
!['  R  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1002.7..png) .
