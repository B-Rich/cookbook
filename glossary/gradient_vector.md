The vector with x and y components
!['   (d(partial) f)/(d(partial)   x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3460.1..png)
and
!['   (d(partial) f)/(d(partial) y) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3460.2..png)

This is often written grad(f) or
!['  //nabla f .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3460.3..png)

The rate of change of f at (x,y) as we move in direction (u,v) is given
by
!['  //nabla f(x,y) . (u,v) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3460.4..png)

!['  //nabla f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3460.5..png) is normal
to surfaces on which f is constant.
