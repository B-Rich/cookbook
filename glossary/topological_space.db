A set X, together with a collection T of subsets of X, satisfying:
\par
$\emptyset$ and X are both in T;
\par
if A and B are in T, then the intersection of A and B is also in T;
\par
if A, B, C, ... K are in T, then the union of A, B, C, ... K is also in T.
\par
We call the sets in T open sets, and we call T a topology on X.
