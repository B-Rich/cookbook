In complex analysis, a function $\phi: \mathbb{C} \mapsto \mathbb{C}, 
\phi(x,y) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ is \emph{analytic}, or \emph{complex differentiable} if its real and imaginary parts $u$ and $v$ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} &=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &=-\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
\end{eqnarray*}
 Functions $u$ and $v$ for which these equations hold true are known as 
 conjugate functions.
