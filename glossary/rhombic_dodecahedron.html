<p>A polyhedron with twelve plane faces, all of which are identical rhombi.</p>
<p>The particular rhombus which makes this solid has its lengths in ratio <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} : 1 , $</span> and its angles are approximately 70.<span class="math">5<sup> ∘ </sup></span> and 109.<span class="math">5<sup> ∘ </sup></span>.</p>
<p>The solid can be constructed by taking a cube, placing an identical cube on each of its faces, and joining the centres of the new cubes to the vertices of the original.</p>
