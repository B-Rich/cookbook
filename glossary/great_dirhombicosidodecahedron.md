The 80th uniform polyhedron is the Great dirhombicosidodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol |3/2 5/3 3 5/2. Its dual is the great
dirhombicosidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(4,5/3,4,3,4,5/2,4,3/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: -56\
 It is two-sided; it has\
 Number of vertices: 60\
 Number of edges: 240\
 Number of faces: 124 (=60 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and
12{5/2}and 12{5/3}and 20{3/2}).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every b^th^ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by
taking five points and joining every second point.
