Let P(x) be a polynomial, and let P'(x) be the derivative of P with
respect to x. Then we define a sequence of functions P~i~ as follows:

P~0~=P,\
 P~1~=P',\
 P~i~(x)=-(P~i-1~(x) mod P~i-2~(x)).

For any real value u, consider the sequence of values P~i~(u) for all i.
Let F(u) be the number of times this sequence changes sign, for a
particular value of u.

Now, Sturm's theorem says that the number of roots of P(x) in the
interval [a,b] is equal to the absolute value of F(b)-F(a).
