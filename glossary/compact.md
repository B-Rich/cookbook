A topological space is compact if every open cover of the entire space
has a finite subcover. For example,
!['  [a,b]  '](../dictionary/equation_images/623.1..png) is compact in
!['  (R)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/623.2..png) (the Heine-Borel
theorem). The continuous image of a compact set is compact, as is a
closed subset of a compact set. Moreover, there is a partial converse in
that every compact set of a Hausdorff space is closed. The compact
subsets of !['  (R)\^n  '](../dictionary/equation_images/623.3..png) are
precisely the closed and bounded subsets. For subsets
!['  X  is a proper subset of eq (R)\^n  '](../dictionary/equation_images/623.4..png)
, !['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/623.5..png) is compact iff it
is sequentially compact iff it is closed and bounded. See also totally
bounded.
