<p>A way of estimating the value of <span class="math"><em>Ï€</em>.</span></p>
<p>If parallel lines a distance 1 unit apart are ruled on a plane, and a needle 1 unit long is dropped onto the plane, the probability that the needle comes to rest across one of the lines is <span class="math">$ \frac{2}{\pi}. $</span></p>
