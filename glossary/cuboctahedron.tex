The 12nd uniform polyhedron is the Cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2|3 4. 
Its dual is the rhombic dodecahedron. 
It can be formed by truncating a cube, or by truncating an
octahedron.

The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
 (3,4,3,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.\par
It has:\par
Euler
 characteristic: 2\par
Density: 1\par
Number of vertices: 12\par
Number of edges: 
 24\par
Number of faces: 14 (=6 quadrilaterals and 8 triangles).
