An equivalence relation $\sim$ defined on a set $S$ is:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{reflexive}: $a \sim a$,
\item \emph{transitive}: $a \sim b \mbox{and} b \sim c \Rightarrow  a \sim c$, and
\item \emph{symmetric}: $a \sim b \Rightarrow b \sim a$
\end{itemize}
for all $a$, $b$, and $c$ in $S$.
\par
Given an equivalence relation on a given set, then the equivalence class of an element $a$
 is the set of elements which are equivalent to $a$ under that relation.
\par
The equivalence classes form a partition of the set.
