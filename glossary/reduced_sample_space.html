<p>When we are dealing with conditional probabilities we sometimes talk about a reduced sample space. For instance, if we know that <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub>1</sub></span> has happened, then the sample space that we are now dealing with is <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub>1</sub>.</span> This is a reduced sample space compared with the original sample space S.</p>
