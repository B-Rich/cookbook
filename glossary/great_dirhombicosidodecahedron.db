The 80th uniform polyhedron is the Great dirhombicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |3/2 5/3 3 5/2. Its dual is the great dirhombicosidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,5/3,4,3,4,5/2,4,3/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -56\par
It is two-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  240\par
Number of faces: 124 (=60 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and 12{5/2}and 12{5/3}and 20{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
