The 72nd uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 3|2. Its dual is the great deltoidal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,5/3,4,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 13\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 62 (=30 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and 12{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
