The hypothesis that the Riemann zeta function
!['  //zeta ( s ) =  the sum of  \^( is a member of fty) \_(n=1) n \^(- s)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3574.1..png)
is equal to zero only when s (which is a complex number) is equal to -2k
for some natural number k, or when the real part of s is 1/2.

This has not been proved, although it has been shown that there are
infinitely many values of s with real part equal to 1/2 for which the
Riemann zeta function is equal to zero.
