A mapping of the form
!['  a  --\>  ax(1-x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2771.1..png) for
some constant a between 0 and 4. As a changes, the properties of the map
show bifurcation; this was the map in which the Feigenbaum number was
discovered. The logistic map is used in some models of animal
populations.
