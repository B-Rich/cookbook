Given a group G and a normal subgroup H of G, the quotient group of G
with respect to H is the set of cosets of H. ie it is
!['  ( gH :    g  is a member of  G . )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3642.1..png)

It is written G/H or G mod H, and it has order |G|/|H|. Its group
operation is: (pH)(qH)=(pq)H.
