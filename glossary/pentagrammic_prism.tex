The 3rd uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic prism; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2|2. Its dual is the pentagrammic dipyramid. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,4,5/2); its symmetry group is the dihedral group D5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 2\par
Number of vertices: 10\par
Number of edges:  15\par
Number of faces: 7 (=5 quadrilaterals and 2{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
