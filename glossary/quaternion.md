An ordered set of four numbers. Sometimes a quaternion is written in the
form x~0~+ix~1~+jx~2~+kx~3~; sometimes it is considered to be a scalar
and a three-component vector.

Quaternions written as above can be added and multiplied, using the
laws:\
 i^2^=j^2^=k^2^=-1;\
 ij=k=-ji;\
 jk=i=-kj;\
 ki=j=-ik.

The set of quaternions is a 4-dimensional vector space over
!['  (R) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/305.1..png) A basis of this
space is 1, i, j, k.
