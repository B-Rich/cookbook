A method for finding the sum of certain series.

If we have a series {a~n~}, and we can find a function f(n) such that
a~n~=f(n+1)-f(n) for every n, then \\

!['  the sum of  \_(i =0 ) \^(n) a\_(i)  =  the sum of  \_(i =0 ) \^(n) f(i+1)-f(i) '](../dictionary/equation_images/4460.1..png)

\\

![' = f(n+1)-f(0) '](../dictionary/equation_images/4460.2..png)

(because all the other terms cancel).

But finding such a function may be difficult, and is not always even
possible.
