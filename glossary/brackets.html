<p>The symbols “(” and “)”, are used to surround an expression that should be evaluated before being combined with the rest of the expression.</p>
<p>For instance the expression <span class="math"><em>a</em>(<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>)</span> means that you should work out <span class="math"><em>b</em> + <em>c</em></span> first, and then multiply it by <span class="math"><em>a</em></span>.</p>
<p>Without the brackets, <span class="math"><em>a</em><em>b</em> + <em>c</em></span> would mean <span class="math">(<em>a</em><em>b</em>) + <em>c</em></span> since multiplication takes priority over addition.</p>
