<p>The 44th uniform polyhedron is the Small rhombidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2 5|. Its dual is the small rhombidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,4,10/9,4/3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -18</p>
<p>It is one-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 120</p>
<p>Number of faces: 42 (=6<span>10</span>and 15 quadrilaterals and 15<span>4/3</span>and 6<span>10/9</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
