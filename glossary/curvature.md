A measure of how curved a line is.

The symbol for curvature is
!['   //kappa .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2227.2..png)

If a curved line is thought of as being made up of very many arcs of
circles, with different centres and radii, then the curvature at any
point is the reciprocal of the radius of the arc at that point. The
symbol for the radius at a given point is
!['  //rho  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2227.3..png), so
!['  //kappa = (1)/( //rho).  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2227.4..png)

In cartesian coordinates, the curvature of a curve at any point is given
by: \\

![' //kappa =  (  ( d \^2 x )/ (dx \^2 ) )/  (  ( 1 +  (  (dy)/(dx)  ) \^2  ) \^ (3/2) ) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/2227.1..png)
