A continuous distribution taking values between 0 and 1, with
distribution function \\

![' f(x) = (1)/(B(m,n)
) x \^(m-1)   ( 1- x ) \^ (n-1) '](../dictionary/equation_images/3108.1..png)

where B(m,n) is the beta function and m and n are positive.

U-shaped distributions and the uniform distribution are special cases of
the beta distribution.
