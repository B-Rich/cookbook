A square or rectangular set of numbers, usually written enclosed in a
large pair of brackets. There are special rules for adding and
multiplying matrices; they are very useful for representing quantities,
particularly in some branches of physics.

Eg:
!['   (  ( 1   2   3 //////// 2   5   7 //////// 1   4   0 )  ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/10087.1..png)
