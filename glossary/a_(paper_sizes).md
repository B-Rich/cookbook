A certain set of paper sizes in common use are called the A-series and
designated A4, A3, etc. They are defined as follows:

Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
!['  1 :  the square root of (2) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4107.1..png)
A0 has area 1m^2^, A1 half of this, A2 a quarter, etc.

So the sizes are:

A0 = 841 × 1189 mm;\
 A1 = 594 × 841mm;\
 A2 = 420 × 594mm;\
 A3 = 297 × 420mm;\
 A4 = 210 × 297mm;\
 A5 = 148 × 210mm;\
 A6 = 105 × 148mm;\
 A7 = 74 × 105mm;\
 A8 = 52 × 74mm;\
 A9 = 37 × 52mm;\
 A10 = 26 × 37mm.

Paper size A*n* has width 2^-1/4-n/2^m and height 2^1/4-n/2^m; the sizes
are rounded down to ensure that two A4 sheets are slightly smaller than
one A3 sheet, etc.
