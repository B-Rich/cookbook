The 75th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahemidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 5/2|5/3. Its dual is the great dodecahemidodecacron.
The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,5/3,10/3,5/2); its
symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: -12\
 It is one-sided; it has\
 Number of vertices: 30\
 Number of edges: 60\
 Number of faces: 18 (=6{10/3}and 6{5/2}and 6{5/3}).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every b^th^ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by
taking five points and joining every second point.
