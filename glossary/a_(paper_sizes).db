A certain set of paper sizes in common use are called the A-series
and designated A4, A3, etc. They are defined as follows:
\par
Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
$ 1 : \sqrt{2} . $ A0 has area $1m^{2},$  A1 half of this, A2 a quarter, etc.
\par
So the sizes are:
\par
A0 = 841 x 1189 mm;
\par
A1 = 594 x 841 mm; 
\par
A2 = 420 x 594 mm;
\par
A3 = 297 x 420 mm;
\par
A4 = 210 x 297 mm; 
\par
A5 = 148 x 210 mm;
\par
A6 = 105 x 148 mm; 
\par
A7 = 74 x 105 mm; 
\par
A8 = 52 x 74 mm; 
\par
A9 = 37 x 52 mm; 
\par
A10 = 26 x 37 mm. 
\par
Paper size A\emph{n} has width $2^\frac{-1-2n}{4}$m and height $2^\frac{1-2n}{4}$m; 
the sizes are rounded down to ensure that two A4 sheets are slightly smaller than 
one A3 sheet, etc.
