<p>This is a test of the null hypothesis that two populations’ variances are in the ratio r. We have two samples of sizes m, n, and we compute unbiased estimates of the population variances <span class="math"><em>s</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span> using divisors m-1, n-1. The distribution used is F with parameters m-1, n-1, and the test statistic is <span class="math">$ \frac{1}{r} \frac{s^2}{t^2} . $</span> Note that we assume the populations are normal, and we should have r less than 1 and s greater than t.</p>
<p>A special case has r=1, in which case this is a test for equality of variances.</p>
