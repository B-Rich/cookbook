<p>A certain set of paper sizes in common use called the B-series and designated B4, B5, etc. They are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio <span class="math">$ 1 : \sqrt{2}. $</span> B0 has area <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} \mathrm{m}^2 , $</span> B1 half of this, B2 a quarter, etc. The A- and B- series of paper together form a series in which each size has <span class="math">$ 1 / \sqrt{2} $</span> the area of the previous size.</p>
<p>The B sizes are:</p>
<p>B0 = 1000 <span class="math"> × </span> 1414mm;</p>
<p>B1= 707 <span class="math"> × </span> 1000mm;</p>
<p>B2= 500 <span class="math"> × </span> 707mm;</p>
<p>B3= 353 <span class="math"> × </span> 500mm;</p>
<p>B4= 250 <span class="math"> × </span> 353mm;</p>
<p>B5= 176 <span class="math"> × </span> 250mm;</p>
<p>B6= 125 <span class="math"> × </span> 176mm;</p>
<p>B7= 88 <span class="math"> × </span> 125mm;</p>
<p>B8= 62 <span class="math"> × </span> 88mm;</p>
<p>B9= 44 <span class="math"> × </span> 62mm;</p>
<p>B10= 31 <span class="math"> × </span> 44mm.</p>
<p>Paper size B<em>n</em> has width <span class="math">2<sup> − <em>n</em>/2</sup></span>m and height <span class="math">2<sup>1/2 − <em>n</em>/2</sup></span>m. The sizes are rounded down to ensure that two B4 sheets are slightly smaller than one B3 sheet, etc.</p>
<p>The height and width of B<em>n</em> paper are the geometric means of the heights and widths of A<em>n</em>and A<em>n+1</em> papers.</p>
