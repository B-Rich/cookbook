<p>The square root of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="math">$ \sqrt{x} $</span>, is what you have to square in order to get <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>; the cube root of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="math">$ \sqrt[3]{x} $</span>, is what you have to cube in order to get <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>; etc. We can talk about the nth root of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="math">$ \sqrt[n]{x} $</span>, which is what you have to raise to the nth power in order to get <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>. In more advanced mathematics <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> need not even be a whole number.</p>
