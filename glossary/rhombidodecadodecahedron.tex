The 43rd uniform polyhedron is the Rhombidodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/2 5|2. Its dual is the medial deltoidal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,5/2,4,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -6\par
Density: 3\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 54 (=12 pentagons and 30 quadrilaterals and 12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
