A nonperiodic (ie it has no translational symmetry) tiling of the plane,
constructed from two different quadrilaterals. The quadrilaterals are a
kite with angles 72°, 72°, 72° and 144°, and a \\'dart\\' or arrowhead
with angles 72°, 36°, 216° and 36°. The vertices of the tiles are
labelled alternately heads and tails, tails being the re-entrant angle
of the dart and heads being the point and bottom of the kite, and the
tiling is assembled by placing tiles so that only vertices of one kind,
heads or tails, meet at any point.

There are an infinite number of such tilings.
