If we have a uniform sample space, then the probability of event E is
!['  p(E) =   (number of outcomes corresponding to E)/(total number of possible outcomes).  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3399.1..png)
For instance if we are throwing a die, the event E: number\>4
corresponds to 2 out of 6 equally likely outcomes, so p(E)=2/6=1/3.
