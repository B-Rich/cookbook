A decimal in which the same pattern of digits repeats over and over
again;

eg one ninth = 0.111111...

one seventh = 0.142857142857....

Sometimes we write recurring decimals by writing out the repeating
pattern once and putting a dot over the first and last digit of it,

eg !['  (1)/(9) = 0..(1)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2246.1..png)

!['  (1)/(7) = 0..(1)4285.(7)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2246.2..png)

but this notation is becoming less common.
