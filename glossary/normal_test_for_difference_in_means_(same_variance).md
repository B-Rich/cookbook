A special case of the normal test for difference in means. Given two
distributions with the same known variance
!['  //sigma \^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1829.2..png) this
is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in their means is
!['  //mu .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1829.3..png) We have two
samples x~i~ and y~i~ of sizes m and n. The distribution used is N(0,1);
the test statistic is \\
![' (
( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) ) - //mu )/  ( //sigma  the square root of  (
(1)/(m) + (1)/(n) ) ) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/1829.1..png)
If the two distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has
to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be
used.
