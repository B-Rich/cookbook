Given a number, multiply its digits together to obtain a new number.
Repeat this process until we reach a single digit. The number of steps
taken to reach a single digit is called the multiplicative persistence
of the original number.

For example,
!['  679  --\>  378  --\>  168  --\>  48  --\>  32  --\>  6 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1570.1..png)
so 679 has multiplicative persistence 5.
