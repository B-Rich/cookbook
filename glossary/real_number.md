A real number, also called just a real, is a number which can be written
out as a decimal, even though it might take forever to do so.

We use the symbol !['  (R)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/83.1..png)
for the set of all rational numbers x=k.x~1~x~2~x~3~... where k is an
integer and each of the x~i~ is one of the digits 0, 1, ...9.

Whole numbers, fractions, irrational and transcendental numbers are all
real. But imaginary numbers are not; something has to lie on the
ordinary one-dimensional number line in order to be real.
