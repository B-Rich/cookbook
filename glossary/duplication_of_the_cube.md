The ancient problem which asks that from a given cube we construct a new
cube with twice the volume of the original. This is to be solved using
only compasses and straightedge.

It is impossible.

It would be equivalent to constructing a line of length
!['   the (3) th root of (2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1554.1..png)
and it can be shown that cube roots cannot be constructed geometrically,
only square roots.

The conchoid of Nicomedes and the cissoid of Diocles were both invented
to help solve this problem (both of them break the rule about only using
compasses and straightedge, as do solutions involving the intersections
of conics, etc).
