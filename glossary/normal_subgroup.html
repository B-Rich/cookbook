<p>Given a group G and a subgroup H of G, H is called a normal subgroup of G if:</p>
<p>H is made up of whole conjugacy classes;</p>
<p>or: <span class="math"><em>g</em><em>H</em><em>g</em><sup> − 1</sup> = <em>H</em></span> for all g in G;</p>
<p>or: gH=Hg for all g in G.</p>
<p>These three conditions are equivalent.</p>
