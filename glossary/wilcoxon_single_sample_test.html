<p>A test of the null hypothesis that a population distribution is symmetrical about M. It makes no other assumptions about the distribution.</p>
<p>We test by ranking values of <span class="math">∣<em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> − <em>M</em>∣; </span> P and Q are respectively the sums of ranks for <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> greater or smaller than M. The test statistic is T=min[P,Q]. Tables are given for use with this test.</p>
