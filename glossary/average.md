Something which is in the middle of a set of data, or represents what is
most common in the data.

It is typical of the rest of the set, it is like most others.

There are three types of average, the mean, the median and the mode.

This word is often used to mean the same thing as arithmetic mean; it is
only used at an elementary level in mathematics.
