<p>Three laws to do with the movement of planets around the sun:</p>
<p>I: a planet’s orbit is an ellipse, with the sun at one focus;</p>
<p>II: the line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times;</p>
<p>III: the cube of the major axis of the ellipse is proportional to the square of the orbit’s period.</p>
