Given circles a~i~, i=1...4, all passing through point Q, let a~i~ and
a~j~ also meet at P~ij~, and let a~ijk~ be the circle though P~ij~,
P~jk~ and P~ik~ (the order of suffices does not matter).

Then a~ijk~, a~jkl~, a~kli~, a~lij~ have a common point P~ijkl~
(Clifford\\'s first theorem).

And P~ijkl~, P~jklm~, P~klmi~, P~lmij~, P~mijk~ all lie on a circle
a~ijklm~ (Clifford\\'s second theorem).

And a~ijklm~...a~nijkl~ have a common point P~ijklmn~ (Clifford\\'s
third theorem).

This sequence of theorems can be continued forever.
