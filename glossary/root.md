The square root of x,
!['   the square root of  (x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/115.1..png),
is what you have to square in order to get x;

the cube root of x,
!['   the  (3) th root of (x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/115.2..png),
is what you have to cube in order to get x; etc.

We can talk about the nth root of x,
!['   the  (n) th root of  (x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/115.3..png),
which is what you have to raise to the nth power in order to get x. In
more advanced mathematics n need not even be a whole number.
