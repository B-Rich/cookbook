A constant, denoted B, which is the sum of the reciprocals of all twin
primes: \\

![' B =  ( (1)/(3)+ (1)/(5)  )  +   ( (1)/(5)+ (1)/(7)  )  +   ( (1)/(11)+ (1)/(13)  )  +   ( (1)/(17)+ (1)/(19)  )  +   ( (1)/(29)+ (1)/(31)  )  +  ... '](../dictionary/equation_images/3207.1..png)

(Note that since 5 occurs in two pairs of twin primes, it appears twice.
Some mathematicians do not do this.)

It is approximately equal to 1.9021605820. The fact that this sequence
converges rather than diverging demonstrates that twin primes are scarce
compared with ordinary primes (whose reciprocal sum diverges), but it
does not tell us whether the total number of twin primes is finite or
infinite.
