For a set of data, we can compute the mean, and we can compute the
deviation of each piece of data, ie how far it is from the mean. The
squared deviation is the square of the deviation, and the mean squared
deviation is the mean of all these squared deviations.

The root mean square deviation is the square root of the mean squared
deviation; ie it is \\
