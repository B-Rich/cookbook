The notation O(f(x)) means that some quantity is less than a constant
multiple of f(x) for every x, once x is sufficiently large.

For example,
!['  g(x) \<= O(x\^2 )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3109.1..png)
means that there is some constant k with the property that
!['  g(x) \<= kx\^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3109.2..png) when
x\>n, for some constant n.
