<p>A nonperiodic (ie it has no translational symmetry) tiling of the plane, constructed from two different quadrilaterals. The quadrilaterals are a kite with angles <span class="math">72<sup> ∘ </sup></span>, <span class="math">72<sup> ∘ </sup></span>, <span class="math">72<sup> ∘ </sup></span> and <span class="math">144<sup> ∘ </sup></span>, and a ’dart’ or arrowhead with angles <span class="math">72<sup> ∘ </sup></span>, <span class="math">36<sup> ∘ </sup></span>, <span class="math">216<sup> ∘ </sup></span> and <span class="math">36<sup> ∘ </sup></span>. The vertices of the tiles are labelled alternately heads and tails, tails being the re-entrant angle of the dart and heads being the point and bottom of the kite, and the tiling is assembled by placing tiles so that only vertices of one kind, heads or tails, meet at any point.</p>
<p>There are an infinite number of such tilings.</p>
