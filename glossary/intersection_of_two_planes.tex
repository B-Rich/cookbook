Two planes that are not parallel intersect in a line.
\par
If the two planes have normals $\v{m}$ and $\v{n}$, their vector equations are $\v{m}.\v{r}=c$ and $\v{n}.\v{r}=d$ for $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$. The angle $\alpha$ between the two planes is the same as the angle between their normals, and can be calculated using from $\v{m}.\v{n} = |m||n|\cos \alpha$.
\par
The cross product of the normals $\v{m} \times \v{n}$ gives a vector at right angles to both and therefore in the direction of the line of intersection of the planes.
\par
Choosing a point $\v{a}$ lying on the line of intersection, we can then write down the equation of this line:
$$
\v{r} = \v{a} + t\v{m} \times \v{n} \,\mbox{where } t \in \mathbb{R}
$$
