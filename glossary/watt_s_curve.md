Given two wheels, each with radius b, with their centres a distance 2a
apart, and a rod of length 2c fixed to the circumference of one wheel at
each end - the locus of the midpoint of the rod as one of the wheels
rotates is called Watt\\'s curve.

It has polar equation \\

![' r\^2 = b\^2 - [ a.sin ( //theta )  (+/-)  the square root of  ( c\^2 - a \^2 cos \^2 ( //theta ) ) )  ] \^2 . '](../dictionary/equation_images/4061.1..png)
