<p>A net of a cone is a sector of a circle. If the cone has slant height h and base circumference c then the sector must have radius h and arc length c. This means that the sector’s central angle is <span class="math">360c/2<em>π</em>h</span> degrees.</p>
<p>To make a complete cone we need to attach to the curved edge of the sector another circle, which will form the cone’s base.</p>
