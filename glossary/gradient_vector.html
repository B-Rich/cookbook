<p>The vector with x and y components <span class="math">$ \frac {\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial 
\mathrm{x}} $</span> and <span class="math">$ \frac {\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y}} . $</span></p>
<p>This is often written grad(f) or <span class="math">∇f.</span></p>
<p>The rate of change of f at (x,y) as we move in direction (u,v) is given by <span class="math">∇f(x,y) ⋅ (u,v).</span></p>
<p><span class="math">∇f</span> is normal to surfaces on which f is constant.</p>
