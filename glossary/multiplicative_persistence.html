<p>Given a number, multiply its digits together to obtain a new number. Repeat this process until we reach a single digit. The number of steps taken to reach a single digit is called the multiplicative persistence of the original number.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math">679 → 378 → 168 → 48 → 32 → 6, </span> so 679 has multiplicative persistence 5.</p>
