<p>For a set of data, we can compute the mean, and we can compute the deviation of each piece of data, i.e. how far it is from the mean. The squared deviation is the square of the deviation, and the mean squared deviation is the mean of all these squared deviations.</p>
<p>The root mean square deviation is the square root of the mean squared deviation; i.e. it is <br /><span class="math">$$\sqrt{ \sum (x_i - \bar{x}) ^2 } .$$</span><br /></p>
