<p>In a space with n dimensions, <span class="math">x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ...x<sub>i</sub>, </span> a Riemannian length function of the form: <br /><span class="math">∑g<sub>ij</sub>(x)dx <sub>i</sub>x<sub>j</sub></span><br /> may be defined and used instead of the normal Pythagorean distance function. This gives a Riemannian geometry, which has properties like those of curved space in a gravitational field. Euclid’s fifth axiom does not hold; nor does the second axiom, which says that a line may be extended indefinitely in either direction.</p>
