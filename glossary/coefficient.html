<p>The constant which multiplies the variable attached to it. For instance, in: <span class="math">2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>y</em> + <em>z</em> + <em>a</em><em>x</em></span>, <span class="math">2</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>, <span class="math">3</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math"><em>y</em></span>, <span class="math">1</span> is the coefficient of <span class="math"><em>z</em></span> (which is often not shown), and <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> is the coefficient of <span class="math"><em>x</em></span>.</p>
