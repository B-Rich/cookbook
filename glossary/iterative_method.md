To iterate is to perform the same procedure over and over again.
Sometimes we can solve equations approximately by iteration, for
example: \\

![' x\^2 + x = 5 '](../dictionary/equation_images/2740.1..png)

\\

!['  =&rt  x =  the square root of (5- x) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2740.2..png)

\\

![' (so, let x)\_(n) =  the square root of (5- x\_(n-1)
) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2740.3..png)

Then, if we take as our first guess x~0~=1, we get:

x~1~=2\
 x~2~=1.7320508\
 x~3~=1.807747\
 x~4~=1.7866877\
 etc (The exact answer is about 1.7912878)
