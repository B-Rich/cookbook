A topological space
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20294.1..png) is sequentially
compact if every sequence in
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20294.2..png) has a convergent
subsequence (converging to a member of
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20294.3..png) ). Compare
compact.
