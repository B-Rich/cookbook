<p>The principal ideal generated by <span class="math"><em>a</em> ∈ <em>R</em></span> is defined as <br /><span class="math">(<em>a</em>) = {<em>a</em><em>r</em> ∣ <em>r</em> ∈ <em>R</em>}.</span><br /> A principal ideal domain or PID is a domain in which every ideal is principal. Such a domain is automatically a unique factorisation domain and, as such, primes and irreducible elements are identical in a PID. For example, <span class="math"><em>K</em>[<em>X</em>]</span> is a PID for any field <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> , but not in general for a ring, e.g.   <span class="math">Z[<em>X</em>]</span> is not a PID as <span class="math">⟨2, <em>X</em>⟩</span> is not principal.</p>
