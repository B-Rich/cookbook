The principal ideal generated by
!['  a  is a member of  R  '](equation_images/20263.2..png) is defined
as
!['(a)= (ar | r  is a member of  R ). '](equation_images/20263.1..png)
A principal ideal domain or PID is a domain in which every ideal is
principal. Such a domain is automatically a unique factorisation domain
and, as such, primes and irreducible elements are identical in a PID.
For example, !['  K[X]  '](equation_images/20263.3..png) is a PID for
any field !['  K  '](equation_images/20263.4..png) , but not in general
for a ring, e.g. \\ !['   (Z)[X]  '](equation_images/20263.5..png) is
not a PID as !['   \< 2,X \>  '](equation_images/20263.6..png) is not
principal.
