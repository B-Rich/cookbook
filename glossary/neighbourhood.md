In a metric space, the
!['  //epsilon  '](../dictionary/equation_images/119.1..png)
neighbourhood of a point P is the set of all points whose distance from
P is less than
!['  //epsilon .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/119.2..png)

In a topological space X, a neighbourhood of a point p is any subset of
X which contains an open set which contains p.
