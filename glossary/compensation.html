<p>In order to perform a calculation on two numbers, we sometimes round one of the numbers to make the calculation simpler. Then we perform an addition or subtraction, to compensate.</p>
<p>Eg <span class="math">99 × 5 : </span> we do <span class="math">100 × 5 = 500, </span> and then we subtract 5 (ie <span class="math">(100 − 99) × 5)</span> to obtain the answer: 495.</p>
