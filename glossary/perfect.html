<p>A perfect number is equal to the sum of its divisors; eg</p>
<p>6 = 1 + 2 + 3,</p>
<p>28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14</p>
<p>Not many perfect numbers are known, because they become very big very soon. But there is a formula for generating some of them, known since Euclid’s time: add together a series of powers of 2 until you get a prime number, and then multiply by the last power of two you used.</p>
<p>eg, <span class="math">2<sup>0</sup> + 2<sup>1</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, </span> which is prime; multiply by 4 to get 28, which is perfect.</p>
<p>All the known perfect number are even.</p>
