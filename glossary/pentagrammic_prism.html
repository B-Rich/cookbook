<p>The 3rd uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic prism; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2|2. Its dual is the pentagrammic dipyramid. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,4,5/2); its symmetry group is the dihedral group D5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 2</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 10</p>
<p>Number of edges: 15</p>
<p>Number of faces: 7 (=5 quadrilaterals and 2<span>5/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
