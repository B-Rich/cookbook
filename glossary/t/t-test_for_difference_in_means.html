<p>Given two distributions with the same unknown variance, this is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in their means is <span class="math"><em>μ</em>.</span> We have two samples <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> of sizes m and n. The distribution used is t with m+n-2 degrees of freedom; the test statistic is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{( \bar{x} - \bar{y} ) - \mu }
{ s / \sqrt {\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} } } ,$$</span><br /></p>
<p>where <span class="math"><em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span> is the pooled unbiased estimate of population variance from the two samples, i.e. computed with divisor m+n-2.</p>
<p>If the two distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be used.</p>
<p>The special case <span class="math"><em>μ</em> = 0</span> may be used to test for equality of means.</p>
