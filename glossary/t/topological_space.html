<p>A set X, together with a collection T of subsets of X, satisfying:</p>
<p><span class="math">âˆ…</span> and X are both in T;</p>
<p>if A and B are in T, then the intersection of A and B is also in T;</p>
<p>if A, B, C, ... K are in T, then the union of A, B, C, ... K is also in T.</p>
<p>We call the sets in T open sets, and we call T a topology on X.</p>
