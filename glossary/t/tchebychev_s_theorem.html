<p>If X is a random variable, and g(x) is a function of x which is not negative, then <span class="math">$ \mathrm{P(g(X)} \geq \mathrm{k)} \leq \frac{\mathrm{E(g(X))}}{\mathrm{k}}, $</span> i.e. the probability that g(x) is greater than or equal to k, is less than or equal to the expectation of g(X) divided by k.</p>
