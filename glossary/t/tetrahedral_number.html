<p>Tetrahedral numbers are the numbers which can be made by considering a tetrahedral pattern of beads in three dimensions.</p>
<p>For example: if we make a triangle of beads with 3 beads to a side, and on top of this we place a triangle with two beads to a side, and on top of that a triangle with one bead to a side, we have made a tetrahedron of beads. In this case the total number of beads is (3rd triangular number)+(2nd triangular number)+(1st triangular number) =6+3+1=10.</p>
<p>In general the <span class="math"><em>n</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> tetrahedral number is equal to the sum of the first n triangular numbers. This is the same as the 4th number from the left in the <span class="math">(<em>n</em> + 3)<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> row of Pascal’s triangle.</p>
<p>We can use the binomial formula for numbers in Pascal’s triangle to show that the nth tetrahedral number is <br /><span class="math"><em></em><sup><em>n</em> + 2</sup><em>C</em><sub>3</sub>, </span><br /> or (n+2)(n+1)n/6.</p>
<p>The only numbers which are both tetrahedral and square are 4 <br /><span class="math">( = 2<sup>2</sup> = <em>T</em><sub>2</sub>)<em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em>19600( = 140<sup>2</sup> = <em>T</em><sub>48</sub>).</span><br /></p>
