<p>Also called the total differential. If f is a function of more than one variable, f(x,y), then the total derivative is written df, and is; <br /><span class="math">$$\mathrm{df} = \frac{ \partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}} \mathrm{dx}
+ \frac{ \partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y}} \mathrm{dy}$$</span><br /> It is defined similarly for functions of more than two variables.</p>
