<p>A knot produced by winding a curve around a torus.</p>
<p>If we consider a torus to be formed as the product of two circles A and B (we form the torus by rotating B around the circumference of A) then a torus knot is produced by winding a curve p times around A and q times around B. Such a knot is denoted <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub><em>p</em>, <em>q</em></sub>.</span> The trefoil is a specific case of this: <span class="math"><em>T</em><sub>2, 3</sub>.</span></p>
