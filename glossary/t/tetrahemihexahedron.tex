The 9th uniform polyhedron is the Tetrahemihexahedron; it has 
Wythoff symbol 3/2 3|2 . Its dual is the tetrahemihexacron. The pattern of 
polygons round each vertex is (4.3/2.4.3); its symmetry group is the
 tetrahedral group A4
\par
It has:
\par
Euler characteristic: 1.\par
It is one-sided; it has
\par
Number of vertices: 6\par
