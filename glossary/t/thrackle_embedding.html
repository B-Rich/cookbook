<p>For a given graph, a thrackle embedding is a function which turns each vertex of the graph into a point, and each edge of the graph into a continuous line, with the conditions that:</p>
<p>Lines do not cross themselves;</p>
<p>Each pair of lines intersects exactly once;</p>
<p>Two vertices connected by an edge will always be turned into two endpoints and a line;</p>
<p>Two lines which intersect must cross at the point of intersection - or they must meet at a common endpoint.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Conway conjectured that there is no graph which has more edges than vertices and has a thrackle embedding.</p>
