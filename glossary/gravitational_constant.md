The constant, which is usually assumed to be the same at all times and
places, which measures the strength of the gravitational force.

In the inverse square law of gravitation,
!['  F = (GM\_1 M\_2)/(r\^2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4425.1..png)
G is the universal gravitational constant.

It is equal to about 6.67390×10^-11^ m^3^/kg/s^2^.

It has dimensions M^-1^L^3^T^-2^ and SI unit Nm^2^kg^-2^.
