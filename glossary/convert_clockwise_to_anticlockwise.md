1/4 turn clockwise is the same as 3/4 turn anticlockwise;\
 1/2 turn clockwise is the same as 1/2 turn anticlockwise.\
 In general, a fraction f of a turn clockwise is the same as a fraction
(1-f) of a turn anticlockwise.

In degrees, this is expressed by subtracting the size of the turn from
360°. For instance, 180° clockwise = 180° anticlockwise, 181° clockwise
= 179° anticlockwise, etc.
