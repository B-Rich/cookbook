A matroid is a finite set E, plus a set I of subsets of E, with the
following properties:

​1) Ø is in I;\
 2) If a set X is in I, then every subset of X is in I;\
 3) If sets X and Y are both in I, and X has more elements than Y, then
there is an element k, in X but not Y, with
!['  Y u ( k )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3591.1..png) also in I.

E is called the ground set of the matroid, and I is called the
collection of independent subsets of E. Subsets of E which are not in I
are called dependent subsets.
