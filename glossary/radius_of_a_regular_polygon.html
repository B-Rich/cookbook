<p>A regular n-gon of side length x has radius R. To find R, consider the triangle OAX, where O is the centre, A one vertex and X the centre of a side next to A. We know that the interior angle of a regular n-gon is <span class="math">$ 180 - \frac{360}{n}, $</span> so angle OAX= <span class="math">$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} , $</span> and we have <span class="math">$ \cos \theta = \frac{x/2}{R} . $</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math">$ R = \frac{x}{2 \cos \theta } . $</span></p>
