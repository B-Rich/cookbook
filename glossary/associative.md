An operation is associative if, when the operation appears twice in an
expression, it doesn't matter where you put the brackets.

For instance, addition is associative because (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)

- this is called the associative law.

And multiplication is associative because (a b)c=a(b c)

But division and subtraction are not associative.
