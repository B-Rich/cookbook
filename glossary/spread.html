<p>Sometimes we are interested in how widely a random variable is spread about its mean value. Two ways to measure this are the variance and the standard deviation.</p>
<p>We could try to use the average value of <span class="math">X − ⟨X⟩, </span> but we find that this is always zero: <br /><span class="math">⟨X − ⟨X⟩⟩ = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>p<sub>i</sub>(x<sub>i</sub> − ⟨X⟩)</span><br /> <br /><span class="math"> = ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>p<sub>i</sub>x<sub>i</sub> − ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>p<sub>i</sub>⟨X⟩ = ⟨X⟩ − ⟨X⟩ = 0</span><br /></p>
<p>Instead we use measures of spread such as the average squared difference between X and its mean.</p>
