<p>A square matrix A for which <span class="math">$ \bar{\mathrm{A}}^{\mathrm{T}} . \mathrm{A} = \mathrm{I} $</span> where <span class="math">$ \bar{\mathrm{M}} $</span> means the matrix whose elements are the complex conjugates of those of M. (If the elements of A are real numbers, then A is an orthogonal matrix.)</p>
