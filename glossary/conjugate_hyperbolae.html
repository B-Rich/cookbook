<p>Two hyperbolae are said to be conjugate if they have the following properties:</p>
<p>They have the same asymptotes;</p>
<p>The transverse axis of one is the conjugate axis of the other, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>This means that they can be written in the form: <span class="math">$ \left \{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
  \frac{x^2}{a^2}- \frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 \\
  \frac{x^2}{a^2}- \frac{y^2}{b^2}=-1
\end{array} 
\right \}$</span></p>
