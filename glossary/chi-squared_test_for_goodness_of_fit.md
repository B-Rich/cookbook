A test of the null hypothesis that a population has a given distribution
f~e~. The test statistic is !['   the sum of  (
(f\_o - f\_e ) \^2 )/ (f\_e) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1820.1..png)
where f~o~ is the observed distribution. We test by grouping the data
into k cells each of which would have expected frequency at least 5; we
estimate any necessary parameters from the data, the number of such
parameters is p. The distribution used is
!['  //chi \^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1820.2..png) with k-p-1
degrees of freedom.
