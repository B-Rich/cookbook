​1) The formula e^ix^ = cos x + isin x, where i is the square root of
-1. A special case of it is
!['  e\^(i//pi ) = -1.  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2487.1..png)

​2) The formula, also called Euler\\'s theorem: V - E + F = 2, for an
ordinary polyhedron (one that is like a sphere rather than, for
instance, like a doughnut), where V is the number of vertices, E the
number of edges and F the number of faces.
