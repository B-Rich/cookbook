Sufficiency conditions for a \`well-behaved\\' periodic function
!['  f(x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.1..png) with period
!['  2L  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.2..png) to have a
convergent Fourier series. These are that
!['  f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.3..png) must be bounded
and have a finite number of maxima, minima and discontinuities for
!['  x  is a member of  [0,2L)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.4..png)
; then the Fourier series will converge to
!['  f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.5..png) wherever it is
continuous, and at a jump discontinuity it will converge to the midpoint
of the two one-sided limits. Not that these are not necessary
conditions, for example
!['  f(x)= sin(1/x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20092.6..png) does
have a convergent Fourier series.
