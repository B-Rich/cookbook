k is used to denote the unit vector in the z direction:
!['  x =  (  ( 0 //////// 1 //////// 0 )  ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2113.1..png)

It can also denote the stiffness of a body.

Small k is also used as an abbreviation for kilo, meaning one thousand -
so for instance 1g means one gram, but 1kg means one kilogram, ie 1000
grams.
