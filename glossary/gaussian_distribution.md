A continuous distribution whose graph looks like a bell-shaped curve.
The distribution is symmetric. The probability density function is \\

![' //varphi ( x ) = (1)/( //sigma  the square root of (2 //pi)
) exp  (   (-(x - //mu ) \^2 )/(2 //sigma \^2)  ) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.1..png)

The mean is !['  //mu  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.3..png) and
the variance is
!['  //sigma \^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.4..png). This
distribution is notated
!['  N ( //mu , //sigma \^2 ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.5..png)
A variable with this distribution can take any finite value.

This distribution occurs very often in real-world sets of data, and it
is often the limit to which the sum of a large number of random
variables tends.

It has MGF \\

![' M( //theta ) = //exp ( //mu //theta + (1)/(2) //sigma \^2 //theta \^2 ) .'](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.2..png)

The cumulative distribution function of an
!['  N(0,1)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.6..png) random
variable is usually written
!['   //Phi (x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2809.7..png) .
