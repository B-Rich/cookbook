<p>The symbols <span> and </span> which are sometimes used in equations to mean the same thing as parentheses; what is inside the braces is to be worked out first, and then combined with everything else.</p>
<p>Sometimes we use braces as well as parentheses, when it would be confusing to have a lot of parentheses; eg:</p>
<p><span class="math">{(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>)(<em>z</em> + <em>x</em>) − (<em>z</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em>)<sup>2</sup>}<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>Braces are also used to define sets. For example, the set of even numbers can be defined by: <br /><span class="math"><em>E</em> = {<em>x</em> ∈ Z∣<em>x</em> = 0mod2}</span><br /></p>
