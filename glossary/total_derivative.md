Also called the total differential. If f is a function of more than one
variable, f(x,y), then the total derivative is written df, and is; \\
![' df = ( d(partial) f)/(d(partial) x) dx  + ( d(partial) f)/(d(partial) y) dy '](../dictionary/equation_images/2825.1..png)
It is defined similarly for functions of more than two variables.
