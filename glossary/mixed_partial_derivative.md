For a function of more than one variable, say f(x,y), a mixed partial
derivative is a derivative formed by partial differentiation with
respect to more than one of the variables, one after another, for
instance
!['  ( d(partial) \^2 f)/( d(partial) x d(partial) y )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2794.1..png)
means f differentiated with respect to x, and then y.

For analytic functions (ie most \\'ordinary\\' functions) the order of
the differentiations does not matter, but for some unusual functions
this is not the case.
