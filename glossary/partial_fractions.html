<p>If we take a fraction A, and write it as the sum of a set of fractions whose denominators are factors of the denominator of A, then the set of fractions is called a set of partial fractions.</p>
<p>For example, if we write <span class="math">$ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} $</span> then <span class="math">$ \frac{1}{2} $</span> and <span class="math">$ - \frac{1}{3} $</span> are called partial fractions.</p>
