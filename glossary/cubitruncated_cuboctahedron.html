<p>The 21st uniform polyhedron is the Cubitruncated cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4/3 3 4|. Its dual is the tetradyakishexahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,6,8); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -4</p>
<p>Density: 4</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 48</p>
<p>Number of edges: 72</p>
<p>Number of faces: 20 (=6 octagons and 8 hexagons and 6<span>8/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
