If a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and A, B, C are
the angles in the triangle; with A opposite a, etc, then: \\

![' (a)/(//sin A) =   (b)/(//sin B) =  (c)/(//sin C) '](../dictionary/equation_images/3576.1..png)

This ratio is also equal to 2R, where R is the radius of the
circumcircle.
