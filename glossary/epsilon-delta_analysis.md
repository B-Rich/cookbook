The symbols
!['  //epsilon  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2660.1..png) and
!['  //delta  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2660.2..png) are commonly
used in analysis to represent quantities that approach zero.
\\'Epsilon-delta\\' analysis often has to deal with situations where
both quantities must go to zero simultaneously.
