<p>The 20th uniform polyhedron is the Cubohemioctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4/3 4|3. Its dual is the hexahemioctacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,4/3,6,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -2</p>
<p>It is one-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 24</p>
<p>Number of faces: 10 (=4 hexagons and 3 quadrilaterals and 3<span>4/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
