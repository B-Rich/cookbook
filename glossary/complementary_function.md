For a given inhomogeneous differential equation, a complementary
function is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous differential
equation.

For example, for: \\

![' (d\^2 y)/(dx\^2) + y   = x\^2+xy '](../dictionary/equation_images/3651.1..png)

a complementary function is a solution to: \\

![' (d\^2 y)/(dx\^2) + y = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/3651.2..png)
