If f(x) is continuous for
!['  a \<= x \<= b  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2780.2..png) and
differentiable for a\<x\<b, then there is some value of x between a and
b, cay c, for which: \\
![' (df)/(dx) ( c ) =   (f(b)-f(a)
)/(b-a) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2780.1..png)
ie there is a point where the tangent to f(x) is parallel to the
straight line joining (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)).
