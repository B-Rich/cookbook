A triangle in which one of the angles is a right angle.

This is the kind of triangle for which the trigonometric functions are
defined.

The side opposite the right angle is always the triangle's longest side;
it is called the hypotenuse.

Pythagoras' theorem tells us about the lengths in a right angled
triangle.
