A 4 by 4 antimagic square is a square arrangement of the numbers
1 to 16 so that the totals of the four rows and four
columns and two long diagonals form a sequence of ten
consecutive integers.

2 by 2 and 3 by 3 antimagic squares do not 
exist, but there are lots of them for larger sizes, eg: 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
