The first imaginary number; it is defined by saying that i^2^= -1.

Note that because i does not lie on the real number line, it is neither
greater than nor less than 1.

i is also used to denote the unit vector in the x direction:
!['  x =  (  ( 1 //////// 0 )  )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2667.1..png)
in two dimensions or
!['  x =  (  ( 1 //////// 0 //////// 0 )  )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2667.2..png)
in three dimensions.

Capital I is used to denote the identity mapping, or the identity
matrix.
