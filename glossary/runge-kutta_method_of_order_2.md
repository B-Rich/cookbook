A method for the numerical solution of first order differential
equations: given equation
!['  (dy)/(dx) = f(x,y)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1729.1..png)
and a starting point x~0~, y~0~, values of y~i+1~ for x~i~=x~i~+h are
given approximately by

y~i+1~=y~r~+(k~1~+k~2~)/2,\
 where k~1~=hf(x~i~, y~i~),\
 k~2~=hf(x~i~+h, y~i~+k~1~).
