A set F with two commutative and associative operations, + and ×, such
that:

1)if a and b are in F then a+b and a×b are in F;\
 2)+ has an identity, 0, and × has an identity, 1, and these are not the
same;\
 3)every element has an inverse under +, and every element but 0 has an
inverse under ×;\
 4)× is distributive over +.

!['   (Q,R,C)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3104.1..png) are all
fields with the operations of addition and multiplication.

The definition can also be written: F is a commutative group under
addition; F/{0} is a commutative group under multiplication;
multiplication is distributive over addition.
