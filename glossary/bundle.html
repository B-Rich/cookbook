<p>A map between two topological spaces A and B, where the sets <span class="math"><em>f</em><sup> − 1</sup>(<em>b</em>)</span> for elements b of B (called ’fibres’), are all homeomorphic to a single space.</p>
<p>The simplest example is the Möbius strip, for which A is the Möbius strip, B is a circle, and the fibres are homeomorphic to an interval on the real number line.</p>
