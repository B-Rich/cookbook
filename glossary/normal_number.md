A number in which, when it is written in base 10, the digits 0-9 occur
equally frequently. If it is written in base 2, the digits 0 and 1 occur
equally frequently, etc. Certain specially constructed numbers can be
shown to be normal, but it is not known whether numbers like e,
!['  //pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1540.1..png) and
!['   the square root of (2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1540.2..png)
are normal.
