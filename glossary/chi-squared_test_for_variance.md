This is a test of the null hypothesis that the population variance is
!['  //sigma \^2 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1904.1..png) We
have a sample of size n and we compute an unbiased estimate of the
population variance s^2^ using divisor n-1. The distribution used is
!['  //chi \^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1904.2..png) with n-1
degrees of freedom; the test statistic is !['  (
(n-1)s\^2)/(//sigma \^2 ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1904.3..png)

We assume that the population is normal.
