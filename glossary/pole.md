A point !['  a  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20251.2..png) in the
domain of a complex-valued function
!['  f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20251.3..png) that has the
property that, for some
!['  m \>= 0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20251.4..png) , the
function \\
!['z  |-\>  (z-a)\^m f(z) '](../dictionary/equation_images/20251.1..png)
is analytic.
