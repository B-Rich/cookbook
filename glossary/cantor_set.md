If we start with a line of length 1, and remove the middle 1/3; then we
remove the middle 1/3 of each of the pieces that are left, and then
remove the middle 1/3 of each of the pieces that are left... etc, then
the set that we are left with after continuing this process forever is
called the Cantor set.

More strictly, the Cantor set can be defined as follows:

Begin with the closed interval [0,1]. Call this C~1~.\
 Now, remove the middle 1/3 of C~1~, ie remove the open interval
(1/3,2/3) from C~1~. What remains is called C~2~.\
 C~2~ consists of two closed intervals. Remove the middle 1/3 of each of
them, ie remove the open intervals (1/9,2/9) and (7/9,8/9). What remains
is called C~3~.\
 Continue in this way.

The Cantor set is the result of continuing this process infinitely far.

More strictly, the Cantor set is the intersection of all C~i~ from i=0
to infinity. (But note that C~i+1~ is contained in C~i~, so the Cantor
set can be thought of as C~infinity~.

The Cantor set contains uncountably many points.
