<p>The curve which is the shape formed by a heavy string (of uniform density) hanging from its end points. It has equation: y=c.cosh(x/c) or <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>c</em>.(<em>e</em><sup><em>x</em>/<em>c</em></sup> + <em>e</em><sup> − <em>x</em>/<em>c</em></sup>)/2.</span></p>
<p>The involute of the vertex of the catenary is a tractrix, the asymptote of which is called the directrix of the catenary.</p>
