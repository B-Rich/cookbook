<p>If an ellipse has semi-major axis (the longest radius) <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> and semi-minor axis (the shortest radius) <span class="math"><em>b</em></span>, then its area is given by <br /><span class="math"><em>π</em><em>a</em><em>b</em>.</span><br /> Note that in the special case of a circle, <span class="math"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span>, so we get the usual formula for the area of a circle.</p>
