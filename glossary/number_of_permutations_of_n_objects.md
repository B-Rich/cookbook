The number of permutations of n objects (the number of ways of arranging
them) is n! or n×(n-1)×(n-2)×...×2×1.

This is because the number of ways of choosing the first object is n;\
 the number of ways of choosing the second object is n-1 (since one
object has already gone);\
 the number of ways of choosing the third object is n-2, etc

So the number of arrangements is n×(n-1)×(n-2)×...×2×1.
