<p>If f(x, y) is a function of both x and y, then the partial derivative of f with respect to x, written <span class="math">$ \frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}}, $</span> is: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}}
= \lim_{\mathrm{h} \to 0} \frac {\mathrm{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}}{\mathrm{h}}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is equivalent to differentiating with respect to x and treating y as though it were a constant. It can also be written <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>.</span></p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math">f(x, y) = x<sup>2</sup> + xy + 2y<sup>2</sup>, </span></p>
<p>then <span class="math">$ \frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}} = 2 \mathrm{x + y} $</span></p>
<p>We can define partial derivatives with respect to z, and of functions of three or more variables, in the same way.</p>
