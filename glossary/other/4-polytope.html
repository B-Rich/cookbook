<p>A four-dimensional polytope; i.e. a 4-dimensional figure analogous to a polyhedron.</p>
<p>There are six regular 4-polytopes; the pentatope, 16-cell, tesseract, 24-cell, 600-cell and 120-cell. There are also ten stellated regular 4-polytopes.</p>
<p>They obey the relationship V+F=E+C, where V, F, E, C are the number of vertices, faces, edges and cells. A cell is kind of 3-dimensional ’face’, eg the cells of a regular tesseract are cubes.</p>
