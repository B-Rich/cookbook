<p>In elementary maths, a vector is a quantity which has both size and direction. For instance the wind might be measured by a vector, since it has both speed and direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is helpful to think of a vector as a directed line segment.</p>
<p>At a higher level we define a vector as a member of a set of objects which obeys the rules of vector algebra - i.e. a member of a vector space.</p>
