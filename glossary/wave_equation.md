In one dimension, \\
![' (1)/(c\^2) (d(partial) \^2 f)/(d(partial) t\^2)  = (d(partial) \^2 f)/(d(partial) x \^2 ) '](../dictionary/equation_images/3487.1..png)
where t is time and x is a space co-ordinate. c is the wave speed. This
equation describes, for instance, the displacement of a vibrating string
at different positions along its length and at different times.
