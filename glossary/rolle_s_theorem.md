If f(x) is continuous in the region
!['  a \<= x \<= b,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2751.1..png)
differentiable in the region
!['  (a \< x \< b,)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2751.2..png) and
f(a)=f(b), then there is a point between a and b at which
!['  (df)/(dx) = 0 , '](../dictionary/equation_images/2751.3..png) ie
there is a place where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.
