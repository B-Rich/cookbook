This is a test of the null hypothesis that two samples drawn from similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the \emph{same} distribution, against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different locations.
\par
The sample statistic is $T=W-m(m+1)/2$, where $W$ is the sum of ranks of the smaller sample, and $m$ is the size of this sample. Tables are given for use with this test.
