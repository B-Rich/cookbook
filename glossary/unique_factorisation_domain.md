Abbreviation: UFD. An integral domain
!['  R  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.1..png) in which every
!['  a  is not equal to  0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.2..png)
has a factorisation
!['  a=up\_1 ... p\_k  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.3..png) ,
unique up to units
!['  u  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.4..png) and permutation
of primes
!['  p\_1, ... , p\_k  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.5..png)
(note that in a UFD, the notions of primeness and irreducibility are
identical).

Every principal ideal domain is a UFD, but not vice versa, e.g.
!['   (Z)[X]  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.6..png) is a UFD
but not a PID, as
!['   \< 2,X \>  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20342.7..png) is not a
principal ideal.
