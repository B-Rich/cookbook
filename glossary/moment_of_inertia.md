A measure of how hard it is to get an object to turn about a particular
axis. It depends on the way the object\\'s mass is distributed about the
axis.

In particular, in the equation of rotational motion
!['  M=I (..)(//theta) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/429.1..png)
where M is the resultant moment on a system and
!['  (..)(//theta)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/429.2..png) is its
angular acceleration, I, the moment of inertia, is the ratio connecting
the two. (Compare this with Newton\\'s second law: F=ma.)

Moment of inertia has dimensions ML^2^ and SI unit kgm^2^.
