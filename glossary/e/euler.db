Leonhard Euler(1707 - 1783) was a Swiss mathematician who is famous for much work 
in mathematics in particular for his studies of polyhedra,  about which he discovered 
a rule:

\par
The number of Vertices + the number of Faces - the number of Edges = 2
\par
This formula also applies to networks: 
the number of Nodes + the number of Regions - the number of Arcs = 2
