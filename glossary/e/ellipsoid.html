<p>A solid with the property that any plane cross-section of it is an ellipse.</p>
<p>An ellipsoid has three axes of symmetry, called the major, mean and minor axes in descending order of length.</p>
<p>The general equation of an ellipsoid whose centre is the origin and whose axes correspond the the x, y and z axis is: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 .$$</span><br /></p>
