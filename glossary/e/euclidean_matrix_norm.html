<p>The Frobenius norm, or Euclidean norm on the vector space of matrices, is defined as follows. Let A be a matrix, and let <span class="math"><em>A</em><sup> * </sup></span> be the Hermitian conjugate of A. Then the norm of A is <span class="math">$ \sqrt { \text{trace} ( A ^{*} A ) } . $</span></p>
