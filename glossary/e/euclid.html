<p>Euclid:</p>
<p>A Greek mathematician(born c. 300BC) famous for his work on Geometry, especially his book called <em>The Elements</em>. He devised a geometry dealing with points, lines and planes based on some specific assumptions, that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a line can go through any two points</p></li>
<li><p>a line can be extended indefinitely in both directions</p></li>
<li><p>all right angles are equal</p></li>
<li><p>one line only can be drawn parallel to a given line through a point not on the line.</p></li>
</ul>
