<p>Distribution of waiting time, distribution of the time between (rare) events.</p>
<p>A continuous distribution for a random variable taking positive values, with frequency function: <br /><span class="math">f(x) = <em>λ</em>e<sup> − <em>λ</em>x</sup>.</span><br /> It has mean <span class="math">1/<em>λ</em></span> and variance <span class="math">1/<em>λ</em><sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
<p>This distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.</p>
<p>It has MGF <span class="math">$ M ( \theta ) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - \theta} . $</span></p>
