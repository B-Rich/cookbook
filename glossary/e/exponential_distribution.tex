Distribution of waiting time, distribution of the time between (rare) events.  

\par
A continuous distribution for a random variable taking positive
values, with frequency function:
\[ \mathrm{f(x)} = \lambda \mathrm{e}^{- \lambda \mathrm{x}} . \]
It has mean $ 1/ \lambda $ and variance $ 1/ \lambda ^2 . $ 

\par
This distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.
\par
It has MGF $ M ( \theta ) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - \theta} . $
