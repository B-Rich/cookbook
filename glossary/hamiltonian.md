For a given dynamical system, described by generalised coordinates q~i~
and generalised momenta p~i~, the Hamiltonian is
!['  H =  the sum of  p\_(i) .(q)\_(i) - L ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/385.1..png)
where L is the Lagrangian of the system, and
!['  .(q)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/385.2..png) is the
derivative of q with respect to time.

(p~i~ are given by !['  p\_(i) = (d(partial) L)/  (d(partial) .(q)\_(i)
) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/385.3..png) )

If L does not depend explicitly on time, then H is the total energy of
the system.
