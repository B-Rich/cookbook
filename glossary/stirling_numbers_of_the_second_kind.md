If we have a set of n elements, and we want to partition it into k
subsets each with at least one element, the number of ways to do this is
called the Stirling number of the second kind, !['  S\_(n) \^(
( k ) )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3554.1..png) or
!['   //(  (n //////// k)  //) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3554.2..png)

For example if we have the set {1,2,3,4} we can partition it into two
subsets in the following ways:

{{1},{2,3,4}}\
 {{2},{1,3,4}}\
 {{3},{1,2,4}}\
 {{4},{1,2,3}}\
 {{1,2},{3,4}}\
 {{1,3},{2,4}}\
 {{1,4},{2,3}}

So !['  S\_4 \^(2) = 7 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3554.3..png)
