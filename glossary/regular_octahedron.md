The 10th uniform polyhedron is the Octahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4|2
3. Its dual is the cube. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: 2\
 Density: 1\
 Number of vertices: 6\
 Number of edges: 12\
 Number of faces: 8 (=8 triangles).

Its circumradius is
!['   the square root of (2) / 2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4240.1..png)
and its volume is
!['   the square root of (2) / 3   '](../dictionary/equation_images/4240.2..png)
if the edge length is 1.
