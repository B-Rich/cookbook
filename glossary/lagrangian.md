For a given conservative dynamical system, the Lagrangian is L=T-V,
where T is the kinetic energy of the system and V is its potential
energy. L is a function of the generalised coordinates q~i~ and
generalised velocities
!['  .(q)\_(i)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/397.1..png) of the
system.

It can be shown that the equations of motion for a conservative system
in this case are !['  (d)/(dt)  (  (d(partial) L)/(d(partial) .(q)\_(j)
)  )  - (d(partial) L)/(d(partial) q\_(j)
) = 0 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/397.2..png)

An analogous function can be defined, giving a similar equation of
motion, for a non-conservative system.
