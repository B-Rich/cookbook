A solid with the property that any plane cross-section of it is an
ellipse.

An ellipse has three lines of rotational symmetry, called the major,
mean and minor axes in descending order of length.

The general equation of an ellipsoid whose centre is the origin and
whose axes correspond the the x, y and z axis is: \\
