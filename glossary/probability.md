Probability measures how likely an event or outcome is.

It is usually shown as a success fraction - the number of ways an event
could happen compared to the total number of events that could happen -
and is written: \\

![' (probability(of special event)
) =   ((No of times that special event occurs))/  (
((Total number of events occurring)
)) '](../dictionary/equation_images/1764.1..png)
