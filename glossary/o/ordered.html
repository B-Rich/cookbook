<p>A set is ordered if it can have a transitive relation <span class="math"> &lt; </span> defined on it so that any two distinct elements of the set <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> either satisfy <span class="math"><em>x</em> &lt; <em>y</em></span> or <span class="math"><em>x</em> &gt; <em>y</em></span>. This enables us to place any pair of elements in a definite order, and hence to place the entire set in order. The real numbers are ordered, but the complex numbers are not.</p>
