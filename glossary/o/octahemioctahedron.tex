The 8th uniform polyhedron is the Octahemioctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 3|3. Its dual is the octahemioctacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,3/2,6,3); its symmetry group is the tetrahedral group A4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 0\par
It is two-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 12\par
Number of edges:  24\par
Number of faces: 12 (=4 hexagons and 4 triangles and 4{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
