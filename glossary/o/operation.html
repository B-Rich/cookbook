<p>The act of combining elements of a set.</p>
<p>Multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting are specific operations used on the set of numbers. Two numbers can be combined using one of these operations to produce a third number.</p>
<p>Using the numbers 8 and 2:</p>
<p>multiplying them produces 16;</p>
<p>dividing them produces 4(or a quarter);</p>
<p>adding them produces 10;</p>
<p>while subtracting them produces 6 (or -6, negative six).</p>
<p>The order of doing operations on numbers is very important.</p>
