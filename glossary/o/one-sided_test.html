<p>Also called a one-tailed test: a statistical test in which the alternative hypothesis has values of the parameter on one side only of the null hypothesis, and falling in a single connected region. For instance, if <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>0</sub></span> were <span class="math"><em>x</em> = 1</span> and <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>1</sub></span> were <span class="math">1 &lt; <em>x</em> &lt; 2</span> then this test would be one-sided.</p>
