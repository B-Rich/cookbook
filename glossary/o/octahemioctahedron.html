<p>The 8th uniform polyhedron is the Octahemioctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 3|3. Its dual is the octahemioctacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,3/2,6,3); its symmetry group is the tetrahedral group A4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 0</p>
<p>It is two-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 24</p>
<p>Number of faces: 12 (=4 hexagons and 4 triangles and 4<span>3/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
