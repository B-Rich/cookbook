<p>A matrix which has a large proportion of its entries equal to zero. The nonzero elements can be clustered in some way, or they could be scattered in the matrix with no pattern. eg the following matrices would usually be called sparse: <br /><span class="math">$$\left ( 
\begin{array}{ccc} 
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 
\end{array} 
\right ), \qquad 
\left ( 
\begin{array}{cccc} 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 5 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{array}
\right ) , \qquad
\left ( 
\begin{array}{ccc} 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
  0 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 \\
  2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 
\end{array} 
\right )$$</span><br /></p>
