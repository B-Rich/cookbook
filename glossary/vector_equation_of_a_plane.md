A plane containing the point a and having direction vectors b and c has
equation x=a+tb+uc, where t and u may be any real numbers.

Note that b and c must not be parallel to one another.

Alternatively: given a point A with position vector **a** and a normal
vector **n**, the plane perpendicular to **n** through **a** has vector
equation
