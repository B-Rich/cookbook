<p>A string <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> is a prefix in another string <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> if <span class="math"><em>y</em> = <em>x</em><em>z</em></span> for some string <span class="math"><em>z</em></span> . A prefix-free code is one in which no codeword is a prefix in another. Note that every prefix-free code is decipherable, but the converse is not true. For example, taking the source alphabet to be <span class="math">$  \\{1,2,3 \\} $</span> and <span class="math"><em>f</em>(1) = 1</span> , <span class="math"><em>f</em>(2) = 01</span> , <span class="math"><em>f</em>(3) = 001</span> gives a decipherable code that is not prefix-free.
