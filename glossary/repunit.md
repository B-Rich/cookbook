A number whose digits are all units, ie 11, 111, etc.

The notation R~n~ is used for the repunit with n digits.

No repunit can be a square, but it is not known if one can be a cube.
Very few of them are prime (R~2~, R~23~, R~19~ and R~317~ are the only
known prime repunits), but it is not known whether there are infinitely
many prime repunits.
