This is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in two
population means is
!['  //mu ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1822.1..png) given a
paired sample (x~i~, y~i~) of size n. The distribution used is N(0,1),
and the test statistic is
!['  ( ( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) ) - //mu )/  (//sigma /  the square root of (n) ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1822.2..png)
This test is identical to the normal test for a mean, treating the
differences x~i~-y~i~ as a single sample.
