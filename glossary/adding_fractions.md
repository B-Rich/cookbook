To add together two fractions, we must first find a common denominator
for the two fractions. When we have done this we can write both of the
fractions with this denominator. Then we can simply add together the
numerators of the fractions. We may have to simplify the result.

eg:
!['  (1)/(2) + (1)/(3)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.1..png)

First we find a common denominator. 6 is a common denominator, because
both 2 and 3 will divide into it.

Now we write each fraction with 6 on the bottom:
!['  (1)/(2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.2..png) becomes
!['  (3)/(6) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.3..png) and
!['  (1)/(2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.4..png) becomes
!['  (2)/(6) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.5..png)

Now our problem is:
!['  (3)/(6) + (2)/(6) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.6..png)
This is the same as
!['  (3+2)/(6)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.7..png) or
!['  (5)/(6) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4192.8..png)
