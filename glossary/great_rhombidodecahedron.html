<p>The 78th uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 5/3 2|. Its dual is the great rhombidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,10/3,4/3,10/7); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -18</p>
<p>It is one-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 120</p>
<p>Number of faces: 42 (=15 quadrilaterals and 6<span>10/3</span>and 6<span>10/7</span>and 15<span>4/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
