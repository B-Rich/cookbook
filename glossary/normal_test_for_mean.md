A test of the null hypothesis that the population mean has value
!['  //mu .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1818.1..png) The
distribution used is N(0,1); the test statistic is
!['  ( (bar)(x) - //mu )/(//sigma /  the square root of (n)
) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1818.2..png) where n is the sample
size; if !['  //sigma  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1818.3..png) has
to be estimated or the population is not normally distributed, then the
test is approximate and a large sample should be taken.
