A topological space
!['  (X, //tau )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.1..png) is
connected if we cannot find open disjoint non-empty subsets
!['  U,V  is a proper subset of eq  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.2..png)
such that !['  X=U u V  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.3..png) .
Such sets !['  U,V  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.4..png) would
be said to disconnect
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.5..png) . Equivalent
conditions to connectedness are that every continuous function
!['  X  |-\>  (Z)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.6..png) is
constant, and that the only subsets that are both open and closed are
!['   Ø  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.7..png) and
!['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.8..png) itself. The
connected subsets of
!['   (R)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20066.9..png) are precisely
the intervals. Compare Hausdorff space, path connected, polygonally
connected.
