The standard error of a sample statistic is the standard deviation of
the difference between that statistic and the corresponding population
parameter. For example, if the statistic t is being used to estimate the
parameter !['  //tau ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2518.1..png)
the standard error of t is the standard deviation of
!['  t - //tau .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2518.2..png)

Unless we say otherwise, we are usually talking about the standard error
of the sample mean, which for a sample of size n is
!['  //sigma /  the square root of (n) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2518.3..png)
where !['  //sigma  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2518.4..png) is the
population standard deviation.

Confusingly, the estimated standard error is sometimes also called the
\\'standard error\\'.
