<p>A square or rectangular set of numbers, usually written enclosed in a large pair of brackets. There are special rules for adding and multiplying matrices that make them handy in representing linear transformations.</p>
<p>For example, the equations</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
x + 2y + 3z &amp;=&amp; 1\\
2x + 5y + 7z &amp;=&amp; 2\\
x + 4y &amp;=&amp; 3\\\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>can be represented by the single matrix equation <br /><span class="math"><strong>Ax</strong> = <strong>B</strong></span><br /> where <br /><span class="math">$$\mathbf{A} = \left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 7 \\
  1 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 
\end{array} 
\right )\mbox{,}\quad 
\mathbf{x} = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
  x \\
  y \\
  z 
\end{array} 
\right )\mbox{,}\quad\mbox{and~}   
\mathbf{B} = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
  1 \\
  2 \\
  3 
\end{array} 
\right ).$$</span><br /> Matrices can represent many physical quantities which have multiple components in a simple but useful form. For example, the various moments of inertia that a solid has about different axes of rotation can be expressed in a single <span class="math">3 × 3</span> matrix.</p>
