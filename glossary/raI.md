A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger
than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper,
bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.

The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, ie
!['  1 :  the square root of (2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4157.1..png)
and RA0 size has area 1.05m^2^, RA1 half this, etc. So the sizes are:

RA0= 860 × 1220 mm;\
 RA1= 610 × 860 mm;\
 RA2= 430 × 610 mm;\
 RA3= 305 × 430 mm;\
 RA4= 215 × 305 mm.
