<p>A number n whose divisors sum to a multiple of n. An example is 120, whose divisors (including itself) sum to <span class="math">360 = 3 × 120.</span></p>
<p>If the divisors sum to 3n, n is called multiply perfect of order 3, or tri-perfect. So orinary perfect numbers are multiply perfect of order 2.</p>
<p>Multiply perfect numbers are known of order up to 8.</p>
