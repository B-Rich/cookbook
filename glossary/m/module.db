Let R be a ring. A right R-module (or simply a module over R) 
is an additive abelian group, M, with a scalar multiplication
$ M \times R \rightarrow M $ satisfying:
\par
(a+b)r=ar+br;
\par
a(r+p)=ar+ap;
\par
a(rp)=(ar)p;
\par
a1=a,
\par
where a and b are in M, r and p are in R, and 1 is the identity
element of R.
\par
(Note that if, instead, R were a field, we would have a 
vector space.)
