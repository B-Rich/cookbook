<p>If (X,F,m) is a measure space and (Y,t) is a topological space, then a function <span class="math"><em>f</em> : <em>X</em> → <em>Y</em></span> is called a measurable function with respect to F, if every member of t is the image of some member of F. <span class="math">(ie <em>f</em><sup> − 1</sup>(<em>A</em>) ∈ <em>F</em>∀<em>A</em> ∈ <em>t</em>).</span></p>
