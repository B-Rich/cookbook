<p>Let R be a ring. A right R-module (or simply a module over R) is an additive abelian group, M, with a scalar multiplication <span class="math"><em>M</em> × <em>R</em> → <em>M</em></span> satisfying:</p>
<p>(a+b)r=ar+br;</p>
<p>a(r+p)=ar+ap;</p>
<p>a(rp)=(ar)p;</p>
<p>a1=a,</p>
<p>where a and b are in M, r and p are in R, and 1 is the identity element of R.</p>
<p>(Note that if, instead, R were a field, we would have a vector space.)</p>
