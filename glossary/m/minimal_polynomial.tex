If A is a matrix representing a linear map, then given any polynomial 
p, p(A) is also a matrix representing a linear map.
\par
We call a polynomial p a minimal polynomial for A if:
\par
p(A)=0;
\par
the degree of p is smaller than or equal to that of any other polynomial q 
that has q(A)=0;
\par
the leading coefficient of p is 1; is p is monic.
\par
It can be shown that there is precisely one minimal polynomial for A.
