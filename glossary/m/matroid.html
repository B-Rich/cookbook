<p>A matroid is a finite set E, plus a set I of subsets of E, with the following properties:</p>
<p>1) <span class="math">∅</span> is in I;</p>
<p>2) If a set X is in I, then every subset of X is in I;</p>
<p>3) If sets X and Y are both in I, and X has more elements than Y, then there is an element k, in X but not Y, with <span class="math">Y ∪ k</span> also in I.</p>
<p>E is called the ground set of the matroid, and I is called the collection of independent subsets of E. Subsets of E which are not in I are called dependent subsets.</p>
