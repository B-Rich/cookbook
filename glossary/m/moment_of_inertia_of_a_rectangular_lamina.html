<p>A rectangular lamina with one pair of edges of length 2l, about an axis in its own plane, bisecting the edges of length 2l, has moment of inertia <span class="math"><em>M</em><em>l</em><sup>2</sup>/3</span> where M is the mass.</p>
<p>About an edge perpendicular to the edges of length 2l, it has moment of inertia <span class="math">4<em>M</em><em>l</em><sup>2</sup>/3.</span></p>
<p>If the sides have lengths 2a and 2b, then about a perpendicular axis through its centre it has moment of inertia <span class="math"><em>M</em>(<em>a</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup>)/3.</span></p>
