<p>A whole number which is equal to the sum of all its factors except itself. For example, 6 has the factors 1, 2, 3 and 6. Ignoring the six and adding the rest of the factors, 1 + 2 + 3, gives 6.</p>
<p>Likewise: 28 = 1+2+4+7+14</p>
<p>The next two perfect numbers are 496 and 8128.</p>
<p>There are not many known perfect numbers.</p>
<p>The first five are 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336. All perfect numbers end in 6 or 8 in base 10, but the 6s and 8s do not alternate. All perfect numbers are of the form <span class="math">2<sup><em>n</em> − 1</sup>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup> − 1)</span> where <span class="math">2<sup><em>n</em></sup> − 1</span> is a Mersenne prime.</p>
<p>It is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers, nor is it known whether there is an odd perfect number.</p>
