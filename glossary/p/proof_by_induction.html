<p>A type of proof:</p>
<p>We have a hypothesis H, which contains the variable n, which is a whole number. We want to prove that H is true for every value of n.</p>
<p>1) So we first prove that H is true for n=1.</p>
<p>2) Then we prove that H being true for n=k implies that H is true for n=k+1.</p>
<p>Then we are done, because 1) and 2) together imply that H is true for n=2; then 2) implies that H is true for n=3; then 2) implies that H is true for n=4... etc.</p>
<p>H is called the inductive hypothesis.</p>
<p>Some philosophers do not accept this kind of proof, because it takes infinitely many steps to prove something. But most mathematicians are happy with it.</p>
