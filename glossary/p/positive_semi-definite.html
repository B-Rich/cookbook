<p>Something (usually a matrix or a polynomial) is called positive semidefinite if it is always non-negative, or if under some standard operation it always gives a non-negative value.</p>
<p>For example a symmetric matrix or a quadratic form A is called positive semidefinite if <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup><em>T</em></sup><em>A</em><em>x</em></span> is non-negative for all nonzero vectors x.</p>
<p>Compare positive definite.</p>
