<p>The slant height of a pyramid is the length of an edge that is not part of the base.</p>
<p>A pyramid whose base is a regular polygon with n sides of length x has slant height s. To find s, note that a regular n-gon of side length x has radius <span class="math"><em>R</em> = <em>x</em>/2cos<em>θ</em>, </span> where <span class="math">$ \theta = ( 90 - \frac{180}{n} ) . $</span> Then we have <span class="math"><em>s</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>h</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>R</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> where h is the height of the pyramid.</p>
<p>So, <span class="math">$ s = \sqrt { h^2 + \frac{x ^2 }{ 4 \cos ^2 \theta } } . $</span></p>
