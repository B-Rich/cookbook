<p>A linkage which allows a straight line to be drawn without a ruler.</p>
<p>The linkage consists of a fixed point A and a rhombus of links BCDE; AB and AD are links also. As point C moves along a curve, E traces out the inverse of this curve.</p>
<p>By adding a fixed point O and a link OC such that OC=OA, we constrain C to move on a circle, so E traces out the inverse of a circle; a line.</p>
