A type of plane geometrical transformation. The perspective affinity defined by
line l, direction d and ratio r operates as follows:
\par
Given a point P, draw a line from P in direction d to meet l at X. Find
P' such that P'X/PX=r. Then P' is the image of P under the transformation.
\par
Isometries, similarities, shears and stretches are all kinds of perspective
affinity.
\par
The composition of one or more perspective affinities is called a general affinity.
