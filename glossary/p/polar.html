<p>Given a conic C and a point P, the polar of P is either</p>
<p>1)the line defined as follows:</p>
<p>Draw a line L through P, which cuts C at A and B. Take the tangents to C at A and B, and find their intersection X. The locus of X as L varies is a straight line; this is the polar.</p>
<p>or 2) the line defined as follows:</p>
<p>Find the two tangents T and U of C which pass through P. The points where these tangents touch C are called D and E. The line M joining D and E is the polar of P with respect to C. (In this case P is called the pole of M with respect to C.)</p>
<p>The second of these two is more commonly used - it is also known as the chord of contact of tangents.</p>
