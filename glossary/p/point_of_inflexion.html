<p>An inflection point, or point of inflection, is a place on the graph of a function, where the second derivative of the function is zero. It is a place where the slope of the graph is not changing, and where the tangent to the graph intersects the graph at that point. It is where the graph’s curvature changes from positive to negative.</p>
<p>For instance, y = <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> + x + 1 has a point of inflection at <span class="math">$ \mathrm{x} = - \frac{1}{3}, $</span></p>
<p>because <span class="math">$ \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \mathrm{y}}{\mathrm{dx}^2} = 6 \mathrm{x} + 2, $</span> which is zero when <span class="math">$ \mathrm{x} = - \frac{1}{3} $</span></p>
