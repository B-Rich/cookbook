<p>A stochastic process in which distinct events occur in such a way that the number of events occurring in a given period of time depends only on the length of the time period. This number of events has a Poisson distribution with mean <span class="math"><em>λ</em>t</span> where t is the length of the time period, and <span class="math"><em>λ</em></span> is a constant.</p>
<p>The length of time which elapses between two successive events has an exponential distribution with mean <span class="math">1/<em>λ</em>.</span></p>
