Something (usually a matrix or a polynomial) is called positive semidefinite if
it is always non-negative, or if under some standard operation it always
gives a non-negative value.
\par
For example a symmetric matrix or a quadratic form A is called
positive semidefinite if $x^{T}Ax$  is non-negative for all nonzero
vectors x.
