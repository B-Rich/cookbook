The 5th uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic crossed antiprism; it has Wythoff symbol |2 2 5/3. Its dual is the pentagrammic concave deltohedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,5/3); its symmetry group is the dihedral group D5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 3\par
Number of vertices: 10\par
Number of edges:  20\par
Number of faces: 12 (=10 triangles and 2{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
