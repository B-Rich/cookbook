<p>Given a circle or sphere with centre O and radius r, the power of a point P with respect to this circle or sphere is <span class="math"><em>O</em><em>P</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>r</em><sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
<p>If we draw a line through P to cut the circle or sphere in two places A and B, then the power of P is equal to PA.PB.</p>
