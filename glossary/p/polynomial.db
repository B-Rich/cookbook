A polynomial expression is an expression in which we have 
whole-numbered powers of the variable multiplied by
numerical coefficients, and added together. The powers of the variable must be
positive integers, or zero.

eg: $$
\begin{array}{l}
3x^{2}$  + 2x + 1\\
x^{11}$  + 2x\\
a_{0} + a_{1}x + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{3}x^{3} + \dots + a_{n}x^{n}
\end{array}
