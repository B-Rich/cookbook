<p>Given a triangle, construct its circumcircle and pick a point <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> on the circumcircle.</p>
<p>Drop perpendiculars from <span class="math"><em>P</em></span> to the three sides of the triangle.</p>
<p>The feet of these perpendiculars are found to lie on a straight line – known as Simson’s line.</p>
