<p>A number associated with a polyhedron. For a Platonic solid, it is written <span>p, q</span>, where p is the number of sides each face has, and q is the number of faces which touch at each vertex.</p>
<p>Given this information, the number of vertices is: <span class="math">$ \frac{4 \mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $</span></p>
<p>The number of edges is: <span class="math">$ \frac{2 \mathrm{pq}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $</span></p>
<p>And the number of faces is: <span class="math">$ \frac{4 \mathrm{q}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $</span></p>
