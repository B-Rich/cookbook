<p>The notation O(f(x)) means that some quantity is less than a constant multiple of f(x) for every x, once x is sufficiently large.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math">g(x) ≤ O(x<sup>2</sup>)</span> means that there is some constant k with the property that <span class="math">g(x) ≤ kx<sup>2</sup></span> when x&gt;n, for some constant n.</p>
