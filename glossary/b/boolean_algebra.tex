Algebra in which we consider a set S and two commutative 
operations + and $\times$, with the rules that:
\par
\begin{enumerate}
\item each of the operations has an identity element in S, and these
elements are not the same;
\item each operation is distributive over the other;
\item each element has an inverse in S under each of the operations.
\end{enumerate}
Note that the operations + and $\times$ are not quite the same as for the ordinary numbers.
\par
This kind of algebra is widely used in logic and set theory.
