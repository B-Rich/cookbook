For banking or scientific purposes it is often considered correct
to round something.5 to the nearest even number (\textbf{not} always upwards).
For instance, 5.5 rounds to 6, but 12.5 rounds to 12.

This method means that we do not add a bias to a large set of 
numbers, by rounding up more often than we round down - but unfortunately
at a lower level we are more often taught to round something.5 upwards all the
time.
