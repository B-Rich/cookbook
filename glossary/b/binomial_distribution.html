<p>A discrete distribution, written B(n, p) and given by: <br /><span class="math">$$P(r) =  {n \choose r} p^r (1-p)^{n-r}$$</span><br /> where <span class="math">$ {n \choose r} $</span> is a binomial coefficient.</p>
<p>It is the distribution of the number of successes out of n independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success.</p>
<p>It has mean np and variance npq.</p>
<p>It has PGF <span class="math"><em>G</em>(<em>t</em>) = (<em>q</em> + <em>p</em><em>t</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup>.</span></p>
<p>As n becomes very large, the distribution becomes narrower, forming a peak around X=pn (i.e. on average, a proportion p of the trials will be successful).</p>
