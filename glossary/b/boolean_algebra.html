<p>Algebra in which we consider a set S and two commutative operations + and <span class="math"> × </span>, with the rules that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>each of the operations has an identity element in S, and these elements are not the same;</p></li>
<li><p>each operation is distributive over the other;</p></li>
<li><p>each element has an inverse in S under each of the operations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the operations + and <span class="math"> × </span> are not quite the same as for the ordinary numbers.</p>
<p>This kind of algebra is widely used in logic and set theory.</p>
