The 65th uniform polyhedron is the Inverted snub dodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |5/3 2 5. Its dual is the medial inverted pentagonal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,5/3,3,3,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -6\par
Density: 9\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  150\par
Number of faces: 84 (=12 pentagons and 60 triangles and 12{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
