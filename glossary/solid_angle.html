<p>Given a closed curve and a point, the set of all the half lines passing through the point and the curve is called a solid angle.</p>
<p>The size of a solid angle is measured by considering a unit sphere centred at the given point; the area of the region of the sphere cut by the solid angle, is the size of the solid angle (in steradians).</p>
<p>The total solid angle round a point is <span class="math">4<em>Ï€</em></span> steradians.</p>
