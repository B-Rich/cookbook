If frequency F is plotted against rank i, the relationship between the
two is of the form
!['  F \~ 1 / i \^a ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2225.1..png)
with a close to 1; ie there is a power-law relationship. This law holds
for many naturally-occurring populations; for example the frequency
distribution of words in texts.
