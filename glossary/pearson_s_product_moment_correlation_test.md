A test of the null hypothesis that the population value of a correlation
coefficient !['  //rho  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1816.1..png) is
zero. Tables are given for use with this test; it assumes that the
population has a bivariate normal distribution. We test by finding the
probability which corresponds to a tail that just contains r, where r is
Pearson\\'s product-moment correlation coefficient.
