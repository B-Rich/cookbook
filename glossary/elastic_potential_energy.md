The energy which a spring or other elastic body has because of its
extension or compression.

A body of stiffness k under extension x stores energy E=kx^2^/2.

A body with modulus of elasticity
!['  //lambda  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2182.1..png) with
original length l~0~ and extension x stores energy
!['  E = (1)/(2) ( //lambda )/(l\_0) x \^2 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2182.2..png)
