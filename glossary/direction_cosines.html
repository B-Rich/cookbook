<p>The direction cosines of a given line through the origin, are the cosines of its direction angles - i.e. the cosines of the angles it makes with the x, y and z axes.</p>
<p>Note that if the direction cosines of a particular line are a, b, c, then <span class="math"><em>a</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em><sup>2</sup> = 1.</span></p>
