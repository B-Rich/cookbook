<p>The Greek letter <span class="math"><em>δ</em></span> (lower case) or <span class="math">Δ</span> (upper case), equivalent in sound to English ’d’.</p>
<p>Small delta often denotes a quantity which we will let tend to zero, in analysis; it can also mean the Dirac delta function, or the Kroneker delta. Large delta may denote the difference between two quantities, the discriminant of an expression, the ’del’ differential operator.</p>
<p>The word delta is sometimes used to mean a triangle shape - or, less frequently and incorrectly, to mean a dart or arrowhead shape.</p>
