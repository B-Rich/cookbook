Given two distributions with the same unknown variance, this is a test
of the null hypothesis that the difference in their means is
!['  //mu .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1844.2..png) We have two
samples x~i~ and y~i~ of sizes m and n. The distribution used is t with
m+n-2 degrees of freedom; the test statistic is \\

![' ( ( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) ) - //mu )/  ( s /  the square root of  (
(1)/(m) + (1)/(n) ) ) , '](../dictionary/equation_images/1844.1..png)

where s^2^ is the pooled unbiased estimate of population variance from
the two samples, ie computed with divisor m+n-2.

If the two distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has
to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be
used.

The special case
!['  //mu = 0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1844.3..png) may be used
to test for equality of means.
