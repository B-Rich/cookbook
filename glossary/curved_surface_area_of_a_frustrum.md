If a frustrum is formed by taking a cone of height h and base radius r,
and slicing the point off to make a frustrum of height a, then:

The curved surface area of the original cone was
!['  //pi r   the square root of ( r\^2 + h\^2 ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/60.1..png)
The curved surface area of the piece chopped off (another cone) was
!['  //pi q  the square root of ( q\^2  + ( h-a )\^2 ) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/60.2..png)
where q is the base radius of the chopped-off cone, ie the radius of the
smaller end of the frustrum: q=r(h-a)/h.

So the curved surface area of the frustrum is the difference between
these two areas:
!['  A = //pi [ r  the square root of (r\^2 + h\^2)   - q  the square root of (q\^2 + ( h-a ) \^2 ) ] .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/60.3..png)

If we only know the height of the frustrum, and the radii of its two
ends, a, r and q, we can find h: h=ar/(r-q) and use the above formulae.
