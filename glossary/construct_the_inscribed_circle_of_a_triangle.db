To construct the inscribed circle of a given triangle:
\par
Construct the angle bisectors of two of the angles of the triangle;
\par
Find the intersection, A,  of the two angle bisectors;
\par
Draw a line through A, perpendicular to one of the triangle's sides;
\par
Mark the intersection of this line with the triangle's side, B;
\par
Use compasses to draw a circle with centre A that passes through B.
