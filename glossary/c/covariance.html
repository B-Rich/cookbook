<p>A statistic which measures the agreement between two sets of data. For variables X and Y, with means x and y, the covariance is Cov(X,Y)=E(XY)-xy.</p>
<p>The covariance of two samples of equal size <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,â€†<em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is: <span class="math">$ \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{xy}} = \sum _{\mathrm{i}} \frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}
( \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}} - \bar{\mathrm{x}} )( \mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}} -
\bar{\mathrm{y}} ) . $</span></p>
<p>Covariance depends on the scale used to make the measurements, unlike correlation, which is another measure of the agreement between sets of data.</p>
