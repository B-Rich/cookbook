<p>If we have a triangle ABC, and we pick a point P and draw lines AP, BP, CP, then these lines will meet the triangle at three points X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>Cevaâ€™s theorem states that: <span class="math">$ \frac{\mathrm{BX}}{\mathrm{XC}}. \frac{\mathrm{CY}}{\mathrm{YA}} 
. \frac{\mathrm{AZ}}{\mathrm{ZB}} = 1 $</span></p>
