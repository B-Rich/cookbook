<p>If it is possible to arrange two solids so that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Their bases are of equal area and in the same plane;</p></li>
<li><p>Their heights are equal;</p></li>
<li><p>Any plane parallel to the bases cuts both solids in sections of equal area,</p></li>
</ul>
<p>then the two solids have the same volume.</p>
