<p>A test of the null hypothesis that a population has a given distribution <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>e</em></sub>.</span> The test statistic is <span class="math">$ \sum \frac{(f_o - f_e ) ^2 } {f_e} , $</span> where <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>o</em></sub></span> is the observed distribution. We test by grouping the data into k cells each of which would have expected frequency at least 5; we estimate any necessary parameters from the data, the number of such parameters is p. The distribution used is <span class="math"><em>Ï‡</em><sup>2</sup></span> with k-p-1 degrees of freedom.</p>
