A set C of functions, which is closed under compositions and contains the identity
functions of all the source and target sets of functions in f.
\par
i.e. if f and g are in C, then fg and gf are in C;
\par
and if f is in C and f maps set A onto set B, then the identity functions
on A and B are both in C.

Most mathematicians simply define a category as a set of objects together with a 
set of 'morphisms' which are functions from one object onto another. 
Composition of morphisms must be associative, and each object
has an identity morphism. An example is the category of real vector spaces,
where the objects are vector space and the morphisms are linear transformations.
