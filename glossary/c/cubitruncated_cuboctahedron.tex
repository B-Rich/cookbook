The 21st uniform polyhedron is the Cubitruncated cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4/3 3 4|. Its dual is the tetradyakishexahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,6,8); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -4\par
Density: 4\par
Number of vertices: 48\par
Number of edges:  72\par
Number of faces: 20 (=6 octagons and 8 hexagons and 6{8/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
