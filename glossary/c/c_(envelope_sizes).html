<p>A certain set of envelope sizes in common use are called the C-series and designated C4, C3, etc. They are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Each envelope size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio <span class="math">$ 1 : \sqrt{2} . $</span> C0 has area <span class="math">$ \sqrt[4]{2} \mathrm{m}^2 ,$</span> C1 half of this, C2 a quarter, etc.</p>
<p>So the sizes are:</p>
<p>C0 = 917 <span class="math"> × </span> 1297 mm;</p>
<p>C1 = 648 <span class="math"> × </span> 917 mm;</p>
<p>C2 = 458 <span class="math"> × </span> 648 mm;</p>
<p>C3 = 324 <span class="math"> × </span> 458 mm;</p>
<p>C4 = 229 <span class="math"> × </span> 324 mm;</p>
<p>C5 = 162 <span class="math"> × </span> 229 mm;</p>
<p>C6 = 114 <span class="math"> × </span> 162 mm;</p>
<p>C7 = 81 <span class="math"> × </span> 114 mm;</p>
<p>C8 = 57 <span class="math"> × </span> 81 mm;</p>
<p>C9 = 40 <span class="math"> × </span> 57 mm;</p>
<p>C10 = 28 <span class="math"> × </span> 40 mm.</p>
<p>Size C<em>n</em> has width <span class="math">2<sup> − 1/8 − <em>n</em>/2</sup></span> m and height <span class="math">2<sup>3/8 − <em>n</em>/2</sup></span> m.</p>
<p>The sizes are rounded down to ensure that two C4 envelopes are slightly smaller than one A3 sheet, etc.</p>
<p>The height and width of size C<em>n</em> are the geometric means of the heights and widths of paper sizes A<em>n</em> and B<em>n</em>, so that A4 fits comfortably into C4, etc.</p>
