<p>If we have a function f defined in the complex plane, and a curve C in the complex plane, then the integral of f along C is called a contour integral and is written <span class="math">∫<sub>C</sub>f(z)dz.</span></p>
<p>Such an integral can be defined as follows: dissect C into n segments with endpoints <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub>0</sub>...<em>x</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.<em>P</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>k</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>z</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> in each segment. The integral is the limit, if it exists, of the sum <span class="math">∑f(z<sub>i</sub>)(x<sub>i</sub> − x<sub>i-1</sub>), </span> as n approaches infinity and the length of the longest segment goes to zero.</p>
