Conjugate angles add up to $360^{\circ}$;
\par
The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = x+iy$ is $z^* = x-iy$;
\par
Conjugate lines of a conic have the property that each contains the pole point of the other;
\par
Conjugate points of a conic have the property that each lies on the polar line of the other;
\par
etc.

In general, conjugate indicates that there is a symmetrical relationship between two objects A and B; there is an operation which will turn A into B and B into A.
