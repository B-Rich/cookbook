<p>The closure of <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> , written <span class="math"><em>Ā</em></span> is the intersection of all closed sets containing <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> ; a point <span class="math"><em>b</em> ∈ <em>Ā</em></span> iff every neighbourhood of <span class="math"><em>b</em></span> contains points of <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> . The closure of a set is closed. We say that a set <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub>0</sub></span> is dense in <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> if <span class="math">$  \bar{X_0}=X $</span> . This means that any point in <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> can be approximated arbitrarily closely by elements of <span class="math"><em>X</em><sub>0</sub></span> .</p>
