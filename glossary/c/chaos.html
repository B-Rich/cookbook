<p>A system, usually in dynamics, is chaotic if:</p>
<p>- it is predictable in principle;</p>
<p>- what happens to it in the long run depends very sensitively on how it is set up in the first place, which makes it very hard to predict in practice</p>
<p>- there is usually some way of describing the general types of long-term behaviour, like a ’strange attractor’.</p>
<p>For instance, the weather, or the movements of three stars around one another, are chaotic systems.</p>
