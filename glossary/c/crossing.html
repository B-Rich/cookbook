<p>Knots are classified by the number of times the ’string’ crosses itself when the knot is projected onto a plane. For any knot this number of crossings has a smallest possible value, which is called the number of crossings.</p>
<p>There exists one prime knot with 3 crossings,</p>
<p>one with 4 crossings,</p>
<p>2 with 5 crossings,</p>
<p>3 with 6 crossings,</p>
<p>7 with 7 crossings,</p>
<p>21 with 8 crossings,</p>
<p>49 with 9 crossings,</p>
<p>165 with 10 crossings.</p>
