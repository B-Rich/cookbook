<p>If four quantities a, b, c, d satisfy a:b=c:d, then we say that they have a common ratio. This is the case, for instance, if a and b are two lengths in a shape, and c and d are the corresponding lengths in an enlargement of the shape.</p>
<p>In a geometric series a, ar, <span class="math"><em>a</em><em>r</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>a</em><em>r</em><sup>3</sup>, </span> ..., r is the common ratio, as the ratio of each term to the previous one is r.</p>
