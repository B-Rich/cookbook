<p>Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857): French mathematician.</p>
<p>He worked on geometry - polygons and polyhedra - symmetric functions, definite integrals, complex functions, differential equations, and other topics. He investigated the conditions for convergence of infinite series, and gave a rigorous definition of the integral operator.</p>
<p>Many pieces of mathematics are named after him; the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy sequences and the Cauchy integral theorem, for instance.</p>
