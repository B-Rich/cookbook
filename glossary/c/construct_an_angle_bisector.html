<p>Given two lines which intersect at A, construct their angle bisector as follows:</p>
<p>use compasses to draw a circle centred on A (the radius does not matter);</p>
<p>mark the places where this circle intersects the two lines, B and C;</p>
<p>use compasses to draw two circles, both of the same radius, centred on B and C;</p>
<p>mark one of the places where these two circles intersect, D;</p>
<p>draw a line through A and D - this is the angle bisector.</p>
