Given a line segment AB, we construct the perpendicular bisector as follows:
\par
use a pair of compasses to draw two circles with the same radius, centred
on A and B;
\par
mark the two places where these circles intersect, C and D;
\par
draw a line through C and D - this is the perpendicular bisector of AB.
