<p>A test which is used to measure how well a given set of observations fit a particular discrete distribution. If the theoretical distribution says that value <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><em>s</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>l</em><em>d</em><em>o</em><em>c</em><em>c</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>E</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> times (expected number of times), and it actually occurs <span class="math"><em>O</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> times (observed number of times), then: <br /><span class="math">$$\chi ^2 = \sum _{\mathrm{i}} \frac{ ( \mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{i}}
- \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{i}} ) ^2 } { \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{i}}}$$</span><br /> has a chi-squared distribution with n-p degrees of freedom, where p is the number of distribution parameters used in calculating the <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>.</span></p>
<p>So if <span class="math"><em>Ï‡</em><sup>2</sup></span> is large, we reject the hypothetical distribution - e.g. if it is large enough to have probability smaller than 5 percent, we would say that the test gave a result that was significant at the 5 percent level, and we would probably reject the hypothesis.</p>
<p>The test can be used to test for a continuous distribution, by grouping the data - but we must be careful not to obtain spurious results by grouping the data arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Also if several of the <span class="math"><em>E</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> are smaller than about 5, the test cannot be used without modifications.</p>
