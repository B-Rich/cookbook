<p>A cofactor of a particular number in a matrix is the determinant of the matrix formed by removing that numberâ€™s row, and its column.</p>
<p>For instance: in <span class="math">$ 
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\
  7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 
\end{array} 
\right), 
$</span> the cofactor of 2 is <span class="math">$ 
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
  4 &amp; 6 \\
  7 &amp; 9 
\end{array} 
\right| 
= 4 \times 9 - 6 \times 7 
= -6$</span></p>
