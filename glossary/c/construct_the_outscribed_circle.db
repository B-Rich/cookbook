Given a triangle ABC, we can construct the outscribed circle as follows:
\par
Draw the perpendicular bisector of AB;
\par
Draw the perpendicular bisector of BC;
\par
Label the point of intersection of these two bisectors, D;
\par
Use compasses to draw a circle with centre D, which passes through A. It will also
pass through B and C, so it is the outscribed circle of triangle ABC.
