<p>A unit of luminous intensity, symbol cd.</p>
<p>The luminance or photometric brightness of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum equals 60 candela per square centimetre.</p>
<p>So, the candela is the luminous intensity (in the perpendicular direction) of a surface of 1/600 000 <span class="math"><em>m</em><sup>2</sup></span> of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of 101 325 <span class="math"><em>N</em><em>m</em><sup> − 2</sup>.</span></p>
