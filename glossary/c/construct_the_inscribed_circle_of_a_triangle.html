<p>To construct the inscribed circle of a given triangle:</p>
<p>Construct the angle bisectors of two of the angles of the triangle;</p>
<p>Find the intersection, A, of the two angle bisectors;</p>
<p>Draw a line through A, perpendicular to one of the triangle’s sides;</p>
<p>Mark the intersection of this line with the triangle’s side, B;</p>
<p>Use compasses to draw a circle with centre A that passes through B.</p>
