<p>Addition is said to be commutative, because it does not matter which way round you add two things together, the outcome is the same:</p>
<p>3 + 5 gives the same result as 5 + 3.</p>
<p>Multiplication is also commutative; you can check this.</p>
<p>Subtraction and division are not commutative.</p>
