<p>The commutator of two elements a and b of a group G is written [a,b] and is defined by: <span class="math">[<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>] = <em>a</em>.<em>b</em>.<em>a</em><sup> − 1</sup><em>b</em><sup> − 1</sup>.</span></p>
<p>In Quantum mechanics, if A and B are operators, then the commutator [A,B] of A and B is AB-BA.</p>
