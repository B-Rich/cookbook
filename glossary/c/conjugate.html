<p>This is a word that is used in different contexts in mathematics to mean different things:</p>
<p>Conjugate angles add up to <span class="math">360<sup> ∘ </sup></span>;</p>
<p>The complex conjugate of a complex number <span class="math"><em>z</em> = <em>x</em> + <em>i</em><em>y</em></span> is <span class="math"><em>z</em><sup> * </sup> = <em>x</em> − <em>i</em><em>y</em></span>;</p>
<p>Conjugate lines of a conic have the property that each contains the pole point of the other;</p>
<p>Conjugate points of a conic have the property that each lies on the polar line of the other;</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>In general, conjugate indicates that there is a symmetrical relationship between two objects A and B; there is an operation which will turn A into B and B into A.</p>
