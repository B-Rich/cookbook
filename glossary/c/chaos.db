A system, usually in dynamics, is chaotic if:
\par
 - it is predictable in principle;
\par
 - what happens to it in the long run depends
very sensitively on how it is set up in the first 
place, which makes it very hard to predict in practice
\par
 - there is usually some way of describing the
general types of long-term behaviour, like a
'strange attractor'.

\par
For instance, the weather, or the movements of three
stars around one another, are chaotic systems.
