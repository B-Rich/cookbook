<p>A force that can be written as the gradient of a potential, i.e. <span class="math">f(x) =  − ∇<em>ϕ</em>(x)</span> for some <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em>(x).</span> The minus sign is conventionally used because it allows us to consider <span class="math"><em>ϕ</em>(x)</span> as the potential energy of the field at x.</p>
