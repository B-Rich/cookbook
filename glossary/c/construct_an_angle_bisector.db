Given two lines which intersect at A, construct their angle bisector
as follows:
\par
use compasses to draw a circle centred on A (the radius does not matter);
\par
mark the places where this circle intersects the two lines, B and C;
\par
use compasses to draw two circles, both of the same radius, centred
on B and C;
\par
mark one of the places where these two circles intersect, D;
\par
draw a line through A and D - this is the angle bisector.
