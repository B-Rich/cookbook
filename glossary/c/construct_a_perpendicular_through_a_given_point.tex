To construct a line perpendicular to a given line L, through a 
given point P:
\par
Use compasses to draw a circle centred on P, large enough to intersect
L twice;
\par
Mark the points where this circle intersects L, A and B;
\par
Use compasses again to draw two circles of the same radius, centred
on A and B;
\par
Mark the point where these two circles intersect, C;
\par
Draw a line through P and C - this is the required perpendicular.
