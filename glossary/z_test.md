A statistical test of the null hypothesis that a population parameter
!['  //mu  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2358.1..png) is equal to a
given value
!['  //mu \_0 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2358.2..png) We
construct a z-statistic for the null hypothesis, ie a statistic which,
under the null hypothesis, has mean zero and approximately a standard
normal distribution. Then we accept the null hypothesis if z is less
than z~p~ for a one tailed test with probability p, where z~p~ is the
pth percentile of the standard normal distribution.
