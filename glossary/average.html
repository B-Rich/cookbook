<p>Arithmetic mean or Mean or Average is perhaps the best known measure of central tendency (of the location) for interval and ratio scale variables.</p>
<p>Arithmetic mean is calculated by summing a set of data values and dividing by the number of values. <br /><span class="math">$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i  .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Arithmetic mean is sensitive to the outlier points, but the median is not.</p>
