A number associated with a polyhedron. For a Platonic solid, it is written {p, q}, where
p is the number of sides each face has, and q is the number of faces which
touch at each vertex.
\par
Given this information, the number of vertices is:
$ \frac{4 \mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $
\par
The number of edges is:
$ \frac{2 \mathrm{pq}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $
\par
And the number of faces is:
$ \frac{4 \mathrm{q}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $
