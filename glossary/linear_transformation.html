<p>A geometric transformation made of a combination of:</p>
<p>rotations centred on the origin;</p>
<p>reflections about lines through the origin;</p>
<p>scalings centred on the origin.</p>
<p>Such a transformation can be represented in coordinates by multiplying every position vector by some particular matrix.</p>
