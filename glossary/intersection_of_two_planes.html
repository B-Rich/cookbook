<p>Two planes that are not parallel intersect in a line.</p>
<p>If the two planes have normals <span class="math"><strong>m</strong></span> and <span class="math"><strong>n</strong></span>, their vector equations are <span class="math"><strong>m</strong>.<strong>r</strong> = <em>c</em></span> and <span class="math"><strong>n</strong>.<strong>r</strong> = <em>d</em></span> for <span class="math"><em>c</em>, <em>d</em> ∈ R</span>. The angle <span class="math"><em>α</em></span> between the two planes is the same as the angle between their normals, and can be calculated using from <span class="math"><strong>m</strong>.<strong>n</strong> = ∣<em>m</em>∣∣<em>n</em>∣cos<em>α</em></span>.</p>
<p>The cross product of the normals <span class="math"><strong>m</strong> × <strong>n</strong></span> gives a vector at right angles to both and therefore in the direction of the line of intersection of the planes.</p>
<p>Choosing a point <span class="math"><strong>a</strong></span> lying on the line of intersection, we can then write down the equation of this line: <br /><span class="math"><strong>r</strong> = <strong>a</strong> + <em>t</em><strong>m</strong> × <strong>n</strong> where <em>t</em> ∈ R</span><br /></p>
