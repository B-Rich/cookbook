If we have n objects and we choose r of them, the number of permutations
of the r objects is ^n^P~r~ ie !['  (n!)/(
(n-r)!)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3411.1..png) or
n×(n-1)×(n-2)×...×(n-r+1).

This is because the number of ways of choosing the first object is n;\
 the number of ways of choosing the second object is n-1;\
 the number of ways of choosing the third object is n-2;\
 ...\
 the number of ways of choosing the r^th^ object is n-r+1.

So the number of ways of making the choice is n×(n-1)×(n-2)×...×(n-r+1).

For example, the number of permutations of 3 objects chosen out of five
is 5×4×3=60.

Note that ^n^P~n~, the number of permutations of n objects chosen out of
n, is n!
