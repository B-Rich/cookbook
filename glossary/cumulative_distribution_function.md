A cumulative distribution function F(x) for a continuous random variable
X gives us the probability that X is less than or equal to a given value
x. So
!['  F(x) = P(X \<= x) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3428.1..png)

If the range of possible values of X is [a, b] then we have F(a)=0 and
F(b)=1.
