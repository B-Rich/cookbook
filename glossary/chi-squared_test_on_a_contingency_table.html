<p>For a contingency table with r rows and c columns, and expected frequency of each cell at least 5, this is a test for the null hypothesis that the row and column classifications are independent. The distribution used is <span class="math"><em>Ï‡</em><sup>2</sup></span> with (r-1)(c-1) degrees of freedom; the test statistic is <span class="math">$ \sum \frac{(f_o - f_e ) ^2 } {f_e} , $</span> where <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>e</em></sub></span> is the expected distribution and <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>o</em></sub></span> the observed function.</p>
