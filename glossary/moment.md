A moment is a force acting around a point; for instance a force loading
a lever causes a moment about the lever\\'s pivot point.

A force F acting along a line whose minimum distance from point P is d,
causes a moment M=Fd about the point P.

A force **F** acting at a point with position vector **r** has moment
**L**=**r**Ã—**F** about the origin.

Moment has dimensions ML^2^T^-2^ and SI unit Nm, Newton metres.
