A snub polyhedron is a polyhedron which has pattern {3, p, 3, q, 3, r}
of polygons round each vertex.

One or two of p, q, r, may be 2, representing a \\'non-face\\' with two
sides. For example, the snub cube has pattern {2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3} meaning
triangle-triangle-triangle-square-triangle.

Many of these polyhedra do not have reflectional symmetry, so they have
a right-handed and a left-handed form.
