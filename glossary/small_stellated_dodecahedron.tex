The 39th uniform polyhedron is the Small stellated dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5|2 5/2. Its dual is the great dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5/2,5/2,5/2,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -6\par
Density: 3\par
Number of vertices: 12\par
Number of edges:  30\par
Number of faces: 12 (=12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
