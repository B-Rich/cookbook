A function f is called convex if
!['  f(tx+(1-t)y)  \<= tf(x)+(1-t)f(y)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2542.1..png)
whenever x and y are in the domain of f, and t is in [0,1].

In other words if a straight line is drawn so as to cut off piece of the
curve, the piece cut off will lie entirely below the line.
