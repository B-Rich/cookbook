Two hyperbolae are said to be conjugate if they have the following
properties:

They have the same asymptotes;\
 The transverse axis of one is the conjugate axis of the other, and
vice-versa.

This means that they can be written in the form: !['   //(  (
(x\^2)/(a\^2)- (y\^2)/(b\^2)=1 ////////  (x\^2)/(a\^2)- (y\^2)/(b\^2)=-1 . )   '](../dictionary/equation_images/1317.1..png)
