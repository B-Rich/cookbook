<p>A set of components - each of which is defined as a function of position in some co-ordinate system - which obeys some given transformation law. A tensor of order n has <span class="math"><em>n</em><sup>2</sup></span> components.</p>
<p>This is a generalisation of the idea of a vector; in fact a vector is a tensor of order 1. A tensor of order zero is a scalar.</p>
<p>A tensor can often be thought of as an array of values and manipulated like a matrix.</p>
