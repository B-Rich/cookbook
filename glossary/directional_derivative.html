<p>For a function of two or more variables, say f(x,y), the derivative in direction (u, v) at point (p, q) is the rate of change of f as (p, q) moves in the direction (u, v).</p>
<p>So it is <span class="math">$ \lim_{(\mathrm{h} \to 0)} \frac {\mathrm{f(p+hu, q+hv)-f(p,q)}}{\mathrm{h}} $</span></p>
