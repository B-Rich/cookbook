A number that is the root of some polynomial equation with integer
coefficients.

So, for instance,
!['   the square root of  (5) + 3  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2428.1..png)
is an algebraic number because it is a root of
![' x\^2 - 6x + 4 = 0,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2428.2..png)
but !['  pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2428.3..png) is not,
because it cannot be written as the root of such an equation.

A complex number may be algebraic (for instance i is a root of
1+x^2^=0).

All rational numbers are algebraic, but not all real or complex numbers
are.

If a number is not algebraic, it is transcendental.
