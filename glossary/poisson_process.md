A stochastic process in which distinct events occur in such a way that
the number of events occurring in a given period of time depends only on
the length of the time period. This number of events has a Poisson
distribution with mean
!['  //lambda t  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3691.1..png) where t
is the length of the time period, and
!['  //lambda  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3691.2..png) is a
constant.

The length of time which elapses between two successive events has an
exponential distribution with mean
!['  1/ //lambda .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3691.3..png)
