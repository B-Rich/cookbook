The centre of curvature of a curve at any point is the centre of the
osculating circle at that point.

The centre of curvature of a curve at a point **r** is given by
!['  c = r + //rho \^(n) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3619.1..png)
where !['  //rho  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3619.2..png) is the
radius of curvature at that point, and
!['  \^(n)   '](../dictionary/equation_images/3619.3..png) is the unit
normal vector to the curve at that point.
