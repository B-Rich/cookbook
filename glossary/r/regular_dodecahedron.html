<p>The 28th uniform polyhedron is the Dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|2 5. Its dual is the icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5,5,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 20</p>
<p>Number of edges: 30</p>
<p>Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).</p>
<p>Its circumradius is <span class="math">$ ( \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{3} ) / 4 $</span> and its volume is <span class="math">$ ( 15 + 7 \sqrt{5} ) /4 $</span> if the edge length is 1.</p>
