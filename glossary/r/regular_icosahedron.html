<p>The 27th uniform polyhedron is the Icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5|2 3. Its dual is the dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 30</p>
<p>Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).</p>
<p>Its circumradius is <span class="math">$ \sqrt { 10 + 2 \sqrt {5}} / 4 $</span> and its volume is <span class="math">$ 5(3+ \sqrt{5} ) / 12 $</span> if its edge length is 1.</p>
