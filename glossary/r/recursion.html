<p>A process that ’bites its own tail’ in some way.</p>
<p>An example is the procedure for finding the factorial of a number; say we want to find 6!</p>
<p>We know that 6! = 6x5!</p>
<p>And we know that 5! = 5x4!</p>
<p>and 4! = 4x3!</p>
<p>and 3! = 3x2!</p>
<p>and 2! = 2x1!</p>
<p>and 1! = 1x0!</p>
<p>and 0! = 1,</p>
<p>so 1! = 1x1 = 1</p>
<p>so 2! = 2x1 = 2</p>
<p>so 3! = 3x2 = 6</p>
<p>so 4! = 4x6 = 24</p>
<p>so 5! = 5x24 = 120</p>
<p>so 6! = 6x120 = 720.</p>
<p>The process is called recursive because we find one factorial by finding another; which in turn is found by finding another... until at the bottom layer there is just one result, 0! = 1, which we already know.</p>
