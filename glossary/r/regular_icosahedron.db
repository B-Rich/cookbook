The 27th uniform polyhedron is the Icosahedron; it has Wythoff 
symbol 5|2 3. Its dual is the dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons 
round each vertex is (3,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral 
group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 1\par
Number of 
vertices: 12\par
Number of edges:  30\par
Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).
\par
Its circumradius is $ \sqrt { 10 + 2 \sqrt {5}} / 4 $ and
its volume is  $ 5(3+ \sqrt{5} ) / 12 $ if its edge length is 1.
