<p>The 6th uniform polyhedron is the Tetrahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|2 3. Its dual is the tetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3); its symmetry group is the tetrahedral group A4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 4</p>
<p>Number of edges: 6</p>
<p>Number of faces: 4 (=4 triangles).</p>
<p>Its circumradius is <span class="math">$ \sqrt{6} / 4 $</span> and its volume is <span class="math">$ \sqrt {2} / 12   $</span> if the edge length is 1.</p>
