A decimal in which the same pattern of digits repeats over and
over again;
\par
eg one ninth = 0.111111...
\par
one seventh = 0.142857142857....
\par
Sometimes we write recurring decimals by writing out the repeating
pattern once and putting a dot over the first and last digit of it,
\par
eg $ \frac{1}{9} = 0.\dot{1} $
\par
$ \frac{1}{7} = 0.\dot{1}4285\dot{7} $
\par
but this notation is becoming less common.
