<p>A number whose digits are all units, i.e. 11, 111, etc.</p>
<p>The notation <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span> is used for the repunit with n digits.</p>
<p>No repunit can be a square, but it is not known if one can be a cube. Very few of them are prime <span class="math">(<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>23</sub>, </span> <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub>19</sub><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>R</em><sub>317</sub></span> are the only known prime repunits), but it is not known whether there are infinitely many prime repunits.</p>
