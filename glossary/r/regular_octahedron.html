<p>The 10th uniform polyhedron is the Octahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4|2 3. Its dual is the cube. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 6</p>
<p>Number of edges: 12</p>
<p>Number of faces: 8 (=8 triangles).</p>
<p>Its circumradius is <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} / 2 $</span> and its volume is <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} / 3  $</span> if the edge length is 1.</p>
