<p>A decimal in which the same pattern of digits repeats over and over again;</p>
<p>eg one ninth = 0.111111...</p>
<p>one seventh = 0.142857142857....</p>
<p>Sometimes we write recurring decimals by writing out the repeating pattern once and putting a dot over the first and last digit of it,</p>
<p>eg <span class="math">$ \frac{1}{9} = 0.\dot{1} $</span></p>
<p><span class="math">$ \frac{1}{7} = 0.\dot{1}4285\dot{7} $</span></p>
<p>but this notation is becoming less common.</p>
