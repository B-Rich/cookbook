<p>Given a vector <span class="math"><strong>a</strong></span> and a direction vector <span class="math"><strong>u</strong></span>, we can write <span class="math"><strong>a</strong></span> as the sum of a part in the direction of <span class="math"><strong>u</strong></span> and a part in another direction. The part in the direction of <span class="math"><strong>u</strong></span> is called the resolved part of <span class="math"><strong>a</strong></span> in direction <span class="math"><strong>u</strong></span>.</p>
<p>It is given by <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{{\mathbf{a}}.{\mathbf{u}}}{|{\mathbf{u}}|}.$$</span><br /></p>
