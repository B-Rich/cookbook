<p>A special strophoid, where the given curve C is a straight line, the fixed point A lies on this line, and the pole lies on the perpendicular to C through A.</p>
<p>So, given a line C, a point A on C and a point K on the perpendicular to C through A, we can construct a right strophoid as follows:</p>
<p>Draw a line l through K which meets C at Q. Find points P and P’ on l so that QP=QP’=QA. The locus of P and P’ as Q moves on C, is the right strophoid.</p>
<p>If C is the y-axis, A is the origin and K is at (-a, 0), the curve has equation: <span class="math"><em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(<em>a</em> + <em>x</em>)/(<em>a</em> − <em>x</em>).</span></p>
