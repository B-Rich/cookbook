<p>Regression is a model which describes one random variable as being dependent of one or more others. Often the relationship between the variables is a straight-line one, which is called a linear regression.</p>
<p>If we have a random variable X and another variable p, then if we express the mean of X conditional up on p as a function of p: <span class="math">E(<em>X</em>∣<em>p</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>p</em>)</span> then this is called the regression of X on p.</p>
