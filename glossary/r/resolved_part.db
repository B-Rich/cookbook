\newcommand{\v}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
Given a vector $\v{a}$ and a direction vector $\v{u}$, we can write $\v{a}$ as the sum of a part in the direction of $\v{u}$ and a part in another direction. The part in the direction of $\v{u}$ is called the resolved part of $\v{a}$ in direction $\v{u}$.
\par
It is given by $$\frac{\v{a}.\v{u}}{|\v{u}|}.$$
