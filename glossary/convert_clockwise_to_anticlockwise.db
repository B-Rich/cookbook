1/4 turn clockwise is the same as 3/4 turn anticlockwise;
\par
1/2 turn clockwise is the same as 1/2 turn anticlockwise.
\par
In general, a fraction f of a turn clockwise is the
same as a fraction (1-f) of a turn anticlockwise.
\par
In degrees, this is expressed by subtracting the size of the
turn from 360$^\circ$. For instance, 180$^\circ$ clockwise = 180$^\circ$ 
anticlockwise, 181$^\circ$ clockwise = 179$^\circ$ anticlockwise, etc.
