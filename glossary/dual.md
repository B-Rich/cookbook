- Let !['  V  '](equation_images/20101.1..png) be a vector space over
!['   (F)  '](equation_images/20101.2..png) . The dual of
!['  V  '](equation_images/20101.3..png) , written
!['  V\^\*  '](equation_images/20101.4..png) , is the set of all linear
maps !['  f : V  --\>   (F)  '](equation_images/20101.5..png) . The
operations of addition and scalar multiplication are defined in the
obvious pointwise manner.

- The dual of a set is the set of continuous linear maps
!['  f : E  --\>   (C)  '](equation_images/20101.6..png) . Note that
!['  f  '](equation_images/20101.7..png) is continuous iff it is
bounded. Such maps are therefore bounded linear functionals.
