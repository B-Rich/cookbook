The 26th uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombihexahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 4/3 3/2 2|. Its dual is the great rhombihexacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,8/3,4/3,8/5); its symmetry
group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: -6\
 It is one-sided; it has\
 Number of vertices: 24\
 Number of edges: 48\
 Number of faces: 18 (=6 quadrilaterals and 3{8/3}and 3{8/5}and 6{4/3}).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every b^th^ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by
taking five points and joining every second point.
