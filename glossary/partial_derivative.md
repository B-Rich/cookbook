If f(x, y) is a function of both x and y, then the partial derivative of
f with respect to x, written
!['  (d(partial)f)/(d(partial)x),  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2456.2..png)
is:

![' (d(partial)f)/(d(partial)x)  =  the limit of \_h  --\>  0)  f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)
)/h) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2456.1..png)

This is equivalent to differentiating with respect to x and treating y
as though it were a constant. It can also be written f~x~.

For example, if
![' f(x, y) =x\^2 +xy + 2y\^2,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2456.3..png)

then
!['  (d(partial)f)/(d(partial)x) = 2x + y  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2456.4..png)

We can define partial derivatives with respect to z, and of functions of
three or more variables, in the same way.
