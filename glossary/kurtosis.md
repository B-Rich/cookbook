For a given frequency function, the kurtosis is a measure of how sharply
the function peaks around its mode.

The coefficient of kurtosis is a quantitative measure of the kurtosis;
it is
!['  //gamma\_2 = (//mu\_4)/(//mu\_2 \^2 ) - 3 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1387.1..png)
where !['  //mu\_i  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1387.2..png) is the
i^th^ moment of the function about its mean.
