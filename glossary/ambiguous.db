Something is ambiguous if it is not clear exactly what it means.
For instance:
\par
'Do not think killing the king is good' could mean either:
\par
'Do not think that it is good to kill the king'
\par
Or: 'Don't worry about it; killing the king is a good idea'.
\par
In mathematics we try to avoid ambiguity as much as possible, 
and use special notation, signs and symbols to make things clear.
