<p>If we draw a pair of perpendicular axes, and move a line of fixed length so that it always touches both axes at its ends, then we will trace out a shape called an astroid.</p>
<p>It has parametric equations <span class="math"><em>x</em> = <em>a</em>.<em>c</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><sup>3</sup><em>t</em>, <em>y</em> = <em>a</em>.<em>s</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><sup>3</sup><em>t</em>.</span></p>
<p>It is also the hypocycloid formed by a circle of radius a rolling inside a circle of radius 4a.</p>
