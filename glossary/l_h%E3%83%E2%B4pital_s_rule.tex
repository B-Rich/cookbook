The prime factorisation of a number is the way of writing that number
as a product of prime numbers. There is only one way to do this
for each number (apart from just changing the order of the prime numbers).

For instance, the prime factorisation of 60 is 2 \ensuremath{ \times } 2 \ensuremath{ \times } 3 \ensuremath{ \times } 5.
