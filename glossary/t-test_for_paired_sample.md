This is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in two
population means is
!['  //mu ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1823.1..png) given a
paired sample (x~i~, y~i~) of size n. The distribution used is t with
(n-1) degrees of freedom, and the test statistic is
!['  ( ( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) ) - //mu )/( s /  the square root of (n) ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1823.2..png)
This test is identical to the t test for a mean, treating the
differences x~i~-y~i~ as a single sample.
