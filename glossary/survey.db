In data handling a survey is a means of collecting a sample of data. The process usually involves four steps: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item deciding what subject is of interest; \par
\item what questions to ask; \par
\item what type of people will you ask; and \par
\item exactly which people will be asked.
\end{enumerate}
A survey can also mean the process of making a detailed accurate map of a piece of land by measuring distances and angles.
