<p>This is a test of the null hypothesis that the proportion of population members having a given property is <span class="math"><em>θ</em>.</span> We have a sample of size n in which p of the members have the property. The distribution used is normal, and the test statistic is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{p - \theta }{\sqrt{ \frac{\theta ( 1 - \theta ) }{n} } } .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>This is an approximate test, and the sample size should be large. <span class="math"><em>θ</em></span> should not be too close to 0 or 1.</p>
