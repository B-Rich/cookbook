In statistics: the fundamental statistical result that the average of a
sequence of !['  n  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20191.1..png)
independent identically distributed random variables tends to their
common mean as
!['  n  --\>   is a member of fty   '](../dictionary/equation_images/20191.2..png)
; thus the relative frequency of an event tends to its probability. See
also strong law of large numbers, weak law of large numbers.
