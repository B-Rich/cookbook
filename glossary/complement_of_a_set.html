<p>The complement of a set, <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>, in a particular domain is the set of all objects which are not in <span class="math"><em>A</em></span>, but are in the domain. It is commonly denoted by <span class="math"><em>A</em><sup>′</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Note that <span class="math"><em>A</em> ∩ <em>A</em><sup>′</sup> = ∅</span> and if <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> is considered to be in domain <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> then <span class="math"><em>A</em> ∪ <em>A</em><sup>′</sup> = <em>S</em>.</span></p>
