<p>1) A particle continues in a state of rest of uniform motion in a straight line unless a force acts on it.</p>
<p>2)If a resultant force acts on a particle, the particleâ€™s linear momentum changes at a rate proportional to the size of the force and in the same direction as the force: <span class="math">$ F = \frac{d}{dt}(mv) . $</span> (In the special case where the mass is constant, this becomes F=ma.</p>
<p>3)When one object exerts a force upon another by contact, there is always a force of reaction equal in size and opposite in direction to the acting force.</p>
