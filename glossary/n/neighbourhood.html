<p>In a metric space, the <span class="math"><em>ε</em></span> neighbourhood of a point P is the set of all points whose distance from P is less than <span class="math"><em>ε</em>.</span></p>
<p>In a topological space X, a neighbourhood of a point p is any subset of X which contains an open set which contains p.</p>
