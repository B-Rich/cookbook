<p>This is a special case of the Normal test for difference in means.</p>
<p>Given two distributions with variances <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, <em>σ</em><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, </span> this is a test of the null hypothesis that their means are equal. We have two samples <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> of sizes m and n. The distribution used is N(0,1); the test statistic is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{ \bar{x} - \bar{y} }
{ \sqrt {\frac{\sigma _1 ^2 }{m} + \frac{\sigma _1 ^2}{n} } } .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>If the two distributions are not normal, or if the variances have to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be taken.</p>
