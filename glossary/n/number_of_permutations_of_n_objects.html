<p>The number of permutations of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> objects (the number of ways of arranging them) is <span class="math"><em>n</em>!</span> or <span class="math"><em>n</em> × (<em>n</em> − 1) × (<em>n</em> − 2) × … × 2 × 1</span>. This is because the number of ways of choosing the first object is <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>; the number of ways of choosing the second object is <span class="math"><em>n</em> − 1</span> (since one object has already gone); the number of ways of choosing the third object is n-2, etc.</p>
