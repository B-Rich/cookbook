The simplest nomogram is a chart consisting of three parallel lines which are 
scaled.  
\par
The scales represent three related quantities.

Often only two of the quantities are known and the nomogram is used to find 
the third quantity by joining the two known quantities by a straight line and 
seeing where it intersects the third line.
