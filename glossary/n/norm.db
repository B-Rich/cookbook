A norm on a vector space is:
\par
A mapping from elements of the vector space to the real numbers;
it is positive for every element of the space, and zero only for the zero 
element. The norm of element v is denoted ||v||
\par
If n is a real number, then ||nv||=|n|.||v||
\par
$ \\| u+v \\| \leq \\| u \\| + \\| v \\| , $ for all u and v in the space.
\par
A norm may be used to define a metric: d(x,y)=||x-y||.
\par
A norm on a matrix is a norm on the vector space of matrices.
