<p>In hypothesis testing, we have a null hypothesis <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>0</sub></span> and an alternative hypothesis <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>.</span> We perform a test in which we compute some statistic; if the statistic falls within some region, called the region of acceptance, we accept <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>0</sub></span>. Otherwise we reject <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>0</sub></span> and accept <span class="math"><em>H</em><sub>1</sub>.</span></p>
