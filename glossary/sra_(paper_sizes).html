<p>A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper, bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.</p>
<p>The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, i.e. <span class="math">$ 1 : \sqrt{2} , $</span> and SRA0 size has area <span class="math">1.15<em>m</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> SRA1 half this, etc. So the sizes are:</p>
<p>SRA0= 900 <span class="math"> × </span> 1280 mm;</p>
<p>SRA1= 640 <span class="math"> × </span> 900 mm;</p>
<p>SRA2= 450 <span class="math"> × </span> 640 mm;</p>
<p>SRA3= 320 <span class="math"> × </span> 450 mm;</p>
<p>SRA4= 225 <span class="math"> × </span> 320 mm.</p>
<p>The sizes are rounded to the nearest centimetre.</p>
