<p>Given a point, and a line through it, we can pick another point P and thus define a sector of a circle. If we then take the locus of P so that the area of the sector remains constant, then this locus is a lituus. It is a kind of spiral.</p>
<p>It has polar equation <span class="math">r<sup>2</sup><em>θ</em> = a<sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
