<p>The simplest nomogram is a chart consisting of three parallel lines which are scaled.</p>
<p>The scales represent three related quantities.</p>
<p>Often only two of the quantities are known and the nomogram is used to find the third quantity by joining the two known quantities by a straight line and seeing where it intersects the third line.</p>
