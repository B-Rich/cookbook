The 50th uniform polyhedron is the Icositruncated dodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 3 5|. Its dual is the tridyakisicosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,6,10); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -16\par
Density: 4\par
Number of vertices: 120\par
Number of edges:  180\par
Number of faces: 44 (=12{10}and 20 hexagons and 12{10/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
