An elastic body under tension obeys the law that the force exerted is
proportional to the extension of the body: T=kx, where T is the tension,
x the extension and k the stiffness of the body.

Alternatively, the force exerted is proportional the the proportional
extension of the body:
!['  T = //lambda (x)/(l\_0) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/750.1..png)
where T is the tension, x the extension, l~0~ the initial length and
!['  //lambda  '](../dictionary/equation_images/750.2..png) the modulus
of elasticity.
