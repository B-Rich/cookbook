A process that 'bites its own tail' in some way.
\par
An example is the procedure for finding the factorial
of a number; say we want to find 6! 
\par
We know that 6! = 6x5!
\par
And we know that 5! = 5x4!
\par
and 4! = 4x3!
\par
and 3! = 3x2!
\par
and 2! = 2x1!
\par
and 1! = 1x0!
\par
and 0! = 1, 
\par
so 1! = 1x1 = 1
\par
so 2! = 2x1 = 2
\par
so 3! = 3x2 = 6
\par
so 4! = 4x6 = 24
\par
so 5! = 5x24 = 120
\par
so 6! = 6x120 = 720.

\par
The process is called recursive because we find one 
factorial by finding another; which in turn is found
by finding another... until at the bottom layer
there is just one result, 0! = 1, which we already know.
