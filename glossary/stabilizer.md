Of an element !['  x  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20301.2..png) of
a set !['  X  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20301.3..png) which is
acted on by a group
!['  G  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20301.4..png) : the set \\
![' G\_x= //( g  is a member of  G | g.x=x //) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/20301.1..png)
It is easy to show that this is a subgroup of
!['  G  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20301.5..png) .
