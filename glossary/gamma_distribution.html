<p>A continuous distribution for a variable which takes positive values; it has frequency function: <br /><span class="math">$$\mathrm{f(x)} = \frac{\mathrm{x}^{\mathrm{a} -1} \mathrm{e}^{- \mathrm{x/b}}}
{ \mathrm{b}^{\mathrm{a}} \Gamma ( \mathrm{a} ) } .$$</span><br /> x, a, and b must be positive, and <span class="math">Î“</span> is a gamma function. If a=1, it is the same as the exponential distribution.</p>
