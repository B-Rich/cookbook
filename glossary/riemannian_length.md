In a space with n dimensions,
!['  x\_1, x\_2, ... x\_(i) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2884.2..png)
a Riemannian length function of the form: \\
!['  the sum of  g\_(ij)  (x)dx  \_(i) x\_(j) '](../dictionary/equation_images/2884.1..png)
may be defined and used instead of the normal Pythagorean distance
function. This gives a Riemannian geometry, which has properties like
those of curved space in a gravitational field. Euclid\\'s fifth axiom
does not hold; nor does the second axiom, which says that a line may be
extended indefinitely in either direction.
