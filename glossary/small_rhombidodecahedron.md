The 44th uniform polyhedron is the Small rhombidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 2 5/2 5|. Its dual is the small rhombidodecacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,4,10/9,4/3); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: -18\
 It is one-sided; it has\
 Number of vertices: 60\
 Number of edges: 120\
 Number of faces: 42 (=6{10}and 15 quadrilaterals and 15{4/3}and
6{10/9}).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every b^th^ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by
taking five points and joining every second point.
