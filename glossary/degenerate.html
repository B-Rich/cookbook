<p>A degenerate triangle has all three of its vertices lying on the same straight line, so the triangle is squashed completely flat; it is hardly really a triangle at all.</p>
<p>In the same way we can talk about other kinds of degenerate objects, like a degenerate parabola which is just a line, or a degenerate ellipse which is just a point.</p>
<p>In general a degenerate object has such parameters that it is not really recognisable as what it it; it looks like something simpler.</p>
