<p>An ordered set of four numbers. Sometimes a quaternion is written in the form <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>i</em><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>j</em><em>x</em><sub>2</sub> + <em>k</em><em>x</em><sub>3</sub>; </span> sometimes it is considered to be a scalar and a three-component vector.</p>
<p>Quaternions written as above can be added and multiplied, using the laws:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
  i^{2} &amp; = j^{2} = &amp; k^{2} = -1 \\
  ij &amp; = k = &amp; -ji \\
  jk &amp; = i = &amp; -kj \\
  ki &amp; = j = &amp; -ik.\end{aligned}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The set of quaternions is a 4-dimensional vector space over <span class="math">R.</span> A basis of this space is 1, i, j, k.</p>
