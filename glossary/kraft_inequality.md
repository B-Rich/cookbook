In information theory: given strictly positive integers
!['  s\_1, ...,s\_m  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20188.2..png) ,
there is a decipherable code with codewords of lengths
!['  s\_1, ...,s\_m  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20188.3..png)
composed of letters from an alphabet of length
!['  a  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20188.4..png) iff \\
!['  the sum of \_(i=1)\^m a\^(-s\_i) \<= 1; '](../dictionary/equation_images/20188.1..png)
if this condition holds there is also a prefix-free code with codewords
of these lengths.
