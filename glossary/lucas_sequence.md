Either:\
 The sequence beginning 1, 3... in which each number is equal to the sum
of the previous two. It is closely related to the Fibonacci sequence.

Or (less usually):\
 The sequence of numbers u~n~ defined by:\
 u~n~=4u~n-1~-u~n-2~.

Usually we take the first two values as u~0~=2, u~1~=4, so the sequence
is:\
 2, 4, 14, 52, 194, 724, 2702, 10084, 37634 ...

Values in this sequence all satisfy the equation s^2^-3r^2^=4 for an
integer value of r.
