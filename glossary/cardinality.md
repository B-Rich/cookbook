The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. For
finite sets this is always a natural number.

Countable infinite sets have cardinality

(\\'aleph-null\\'); the set of real numbers has cardinality
!['  //aleph \_1 .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3242.2..png)

The cardinality of a set A can be written n(A), |A|, or
!['  (bar)(A).  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3242.3..png)
