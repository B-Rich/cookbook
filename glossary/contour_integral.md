If we have a function f defined in the complex plane, and a curve C in
the complex plane, then the integral of f along C is called a contour
integral and is written
!['   the integral of  \_(C)  f(z)dz .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/10091.1..png)

Such an integral can be defined as follows: dissect C into n segments
with endpoints x~0~...x~n~. Pick a point z~i~ in each segment. The
integral is the limit, if it exists, of the sum
!['   the sum of  f(z \_(i) ) ( x\_(i) - x\_(i-1)  ) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/10091.2..png)
as n approaches infinity and the length of the longest segment goes to
zero.
