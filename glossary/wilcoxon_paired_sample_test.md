A test of the null hypothesis that two paired samples drawn from
similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the *same* distribution,
against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different
locations.

The samples x~i~, y~i~ give values d~i~=x~i~-y~i~; then | d~i~| are
ranked. P and Q are respectively the sums of ranks for positive and
negative d~i~. The test statistic is T=min[P,Q]. Tables are given for
use with this test.
