<p>The 25th uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4/3 2 3|. Its dual is the great disdyakisdodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,4,6); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 48</p>
<p>Number of edges: 72</p>
<p>Number of faces: 26 (=8 hexagons and 12 quadrilaterals and 6<span>8/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
