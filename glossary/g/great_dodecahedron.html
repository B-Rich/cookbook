<p>The 40th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/2|2 5. Its dual is the small stellated dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5,5,5,5,5)/2; its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -6</p>
<p>Density: 3</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 30</p>
<p>Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
