<p>A continuous distribution whose graph looks like a bell-shaped curve. The distribution is symmetric. The probability density function is <br /><span class="math">$$\varphi ( x ) = \frac{1}{ \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \mathrm{exp} \left ( 
\frac{-(\mathrm{x} - \mu ) ^2 }{2 \sigma ^2} \right )$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The mean is <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span> and the variance is <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sup>2</sup></span>. This distribution is notated <span class="math">N(<em>μ</em>, <em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>).</span> A variable with this distribution can take any finite value.</p>
<p>This distribution occurs very often in real-world sets of data, and it is often the limit to which the sum of a large number of random variables tends.</p>
<p>It has MGF <br /><span class="math">$$M( \theta ) = \exp ( \mu \theta + \frac{1}{2} \sigma ^2 \theta ^2 ) .$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The cumulative distribution function of an <span class="math"><em>N</em>(0, 1)</span> random variable is usually written <span class="math">Φ(<em>x</em>)</span> .</p>
