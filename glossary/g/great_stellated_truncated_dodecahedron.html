<p>The 71st uniform polyhedron is the Great stellated truncated dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 3|5/3. Its dual is the great triakisicosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,10/3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 13</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 90</p>
<p>Number of faces: 32 (=12<span>10/3</span>and 20 triangles).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
