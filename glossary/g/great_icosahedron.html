<p>The 58th uniform polyhedron is the Great icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/2|2 3. Its dual is the great stellated dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,3,3)/2; its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 7</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 30</p>
<p>Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
