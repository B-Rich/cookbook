<p>The 70th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahemicosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|3. Its dual is the great dodecahemicosacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,5/4,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -8</p>
<p>It is one-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 30</p>
<p>Number of edges: 60</p>
<p>Number of faces: 22 (=10 hexagons and 6 pentagons and 6<span>5/4</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
