The 71st uniform polyhedron is the Great stellated truncated dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 3|5/3. Its dual is the great triakisicosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,10/3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 13\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  90\par
Number of faces: 32 (=12{10/3}and 20 triangles).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
