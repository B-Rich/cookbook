<p>The 22nd uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombicuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 4|2. Its dual is the great deltoidal icositetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,3/2,4,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 5</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 24</p>
<p>Number of edges: 48</p>
<p>Number of faces: 26 (=18 quadrilaterals and 8<span>3/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
