<p>The 73rd uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated icosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 2 3|. Its dual is the great disdyakistriacontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,4,6); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 13</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 120</p>
<p>Number of edges: 180</p>
<p>Number of faces: 62 (=20 hexagons and 30 quadrilaterals and 12<span>10/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
