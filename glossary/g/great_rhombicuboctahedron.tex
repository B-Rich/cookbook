The 22nd uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombicuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 4|2. Its dual is the great deltoidal icositetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,3/2,4,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 5\par
Number of vertices: 24\par
Number of edges:  48\par
Number of faces: 26 (=18 quadrilaterals and 8{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
