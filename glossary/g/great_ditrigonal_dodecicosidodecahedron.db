The 47th uniform polyhedron is the Great ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3 5|5/3. Its dual is the great ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,3,10/3,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -16\par
Density: 4\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 44 (=12 pentagons and 12{10/3}and 20 triangles).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
