<p>The 41st uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2|5/2 5. Its dual is the medial rhombic triacontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5,5/2,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -6</p>
<p>Density: 3</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 30</p>
<p>Number of edges: 60</p>
<p>Number of faces: 24 (=12 pentagons and 12<span>5/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
