The 58th uniform polyhedron is the Great icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/2|2 3. Its dual is the great stellated dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,3,3)/2; its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 7\par
Number of vertices: 12\par
Number of edges:  30\par
Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
