The 53rd uniform polyhedron is the Great icosicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3/2 5|3. Its dual is the great icosacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,3/2,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
Density: 6\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 52 (=20 hexagons and 12 pentagons and 20{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
