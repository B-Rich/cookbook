<p>The golden ratio is the ratio p:q that satisfies p:q = q:(p-q).</p>
<p>If we divide a line into two parts, so that the ratio of the larger part to the smaller part is equal to the ratio of the whole line to the larger part, then this ratio is the golden ratio.</p>
<p>The value of the golden ratio is <span class="math">$ (1 + \sqrt{5} ) / 2 , $</span> or about 1.618. The ratio of successive terms in the Fibonacci sequence approaches this ratio, as the terms become very large.</p>
<p>A rectangle whose sides are in the golden ratio to one another, is called a golden rectangle. This shape has been widely used in painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>As a continued fraction, the golden ratio can be written: <br /><span class="math">$$1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + ...}}} .$$</span><br /></p>
