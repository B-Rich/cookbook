<p>The 62nd uniform polyhedron is the Great snub icosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |2 5/2 3. Its dual is the great pentagonal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,5/2,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 7</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 150</p>
<p>Number of faces: 92 (=80 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
