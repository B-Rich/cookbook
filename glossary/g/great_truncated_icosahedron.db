The 60th uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2|3. Its dual is the great stellapentakisdodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,6,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 7\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  90\par
Number of faces: 32 (=20 hexagons and 12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
