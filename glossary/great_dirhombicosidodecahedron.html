<p>The 80th uniform polyhedron is the Great dirhombicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |3/2 5/3 3 5/2. Its dual is the great dirhombicosidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,5/3,4,3,4,5/2,4,3/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -56</p>
<p>It is two-sided; it has</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 240</p>
<p>Number of faces: 124 (=60 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>and 12<span>5/3</span>and 20<span>3/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
