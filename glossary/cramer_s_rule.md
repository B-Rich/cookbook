If we have a system of linear equations which can be written Ax=b, then
Cramer\\'s rule can tell us how to find the components of x, as long as
A is an invertible matrix.

Let D=|A|, the determinant of A.

Let A~1~ be a matrix which is formed from A by replacing the 1st column
with the vector b. Similarly let A~2~ be a matrix which is formed from A
by replacing the 2nd column with the vector b.

Now let D~1~=|A~1~|, the determinant of A~1~, etc.

Then if we write x like
!['   (  (x\_1 //////// x\_2  //////// x\_3 )  ) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4416.1..png)
we have:

x~1~=D~1~/D,\
 x~2~=D~2~/D,\
 etc.
