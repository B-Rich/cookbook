The Greek letter
!['  //pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.1..png) (lower case) or
!['  //Pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.2..png) (upper case),
equivalent in sound to the English p.

!['  //pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.3..png) is commonly
used to represent the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter.

That is, !['  //pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.4..png) = C/d

This ratio has a particular value and is approximately 3.142 or 22/7; it
cannot be shown as an exact fraction or decimal.

This ratio is needed when either the circumference of circle has to be
found: C =
!['  //pi × D ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.5..png) or the
area of a circle is being calculated: A =
!['  //pi × r × r ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1744.6..png) where
r is the radius of the circle.

To a few dozen decimal places, the value of pi is
3.141592551104866223558431126381048812355898112276391048823661691
