The 42nd uniform polyhedron is the Truncated great dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2|5. Its dual is the small stellapentakisdodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,10,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -6\par
Density: 3\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  90\par
Number of faces: 24 (=12{10}and 12{5/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
