For the purposes of the mathematical study of games, known as game theory, a game is
a competitive situation where:
\par
There are a finite number of players;
\par
Each player has a finite number of choices of what to do at each stage;
\par
A player does not know in advance what the other players are going to do;
\par
At the end of the game, the players win or lose something, depending on
the outcome of the game.
