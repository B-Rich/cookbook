<p>The following problem is called the Josephus problem:</p>
<p>m people stand in a circle, and an extra person goes round the circle eliminating every <span class="math"><em>n</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> person. When the end of the circle is reached, we go round again, ignoring people who have already been eliminated, and still eliminating every <span class="math"><em>n</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> person. The problem: given m and n, where should I stand in the circle so that I will be the last to be eliminated?</p>
