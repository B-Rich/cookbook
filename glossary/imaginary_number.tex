The square roots of 9 are 3 and -3.
\par
The square roots of 4 are 2 and -2.
\par
The square roots of 1 are 1 and -1.
\par
We notice that -1 and other negative numbers don't have square roots.
But sometimes it would be very useful if every number had a square root.
\par
So we imagine that there is a number, called i, which is defined by saying
that when you square it you get -1.
\par
So then the square roots of -1 are i and -i.
\par
The square roots of -4 are 2i and -2i.
\par
etc. \par
We call i, 2i, etc. imaginary numbers, and we say that they lie along a number
line like the ordinary, real, number line, but at right angles to it.
These two number lines together form a plane called the complex plane.
