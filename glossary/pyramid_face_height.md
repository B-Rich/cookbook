The face height of a pyramid is the distance from the apex to the centre
of one of the base\\'s edges.

A pyramid whose base is a regular n-gon with side length x and whose
apex is directly above the centre of the base, has face height f.

to find f, note that the short radius of a regular n-gon is
!['  r = (x //tan //theta )/(2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2524.1..png)
where
!['  //theta = 90 - (180)/(n) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2524.2..png)
Then we have f^2^=h^2^+r^2^, where h is the height of the pyramid.

So
!['  f =  the square root of (h\^2 + (x\^2 //tan \^2 //theta )/(4) ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2524.3..png)
