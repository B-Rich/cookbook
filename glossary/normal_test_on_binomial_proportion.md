This is a test of the null hypothesis that the proportion of population
members having a given property is
!['  //theta .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1902.2..png) We have a
sample of size n in which p of the members have the property. The
distribution used is normal, and the test statistic is \\

![' (p - //theta )/( the square root of ( (//theta ( 1 - //theta ) )/(n) ) ) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/1902.1..png)

This is an approximate test, and the sample size should be large.
!['  //theta  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1902.3..png) should not
be too close to 0 or 1.
