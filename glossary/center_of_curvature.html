<p>The centre of curvature of a curve at any point is the centre of the osculating circle at that point.</p>
<p>The centre of curvature of a curve at a point <strong>r</strong> is given by <span class="math"><em>c</em> = <em>r</em> + <em>ρ</em><em>n̂</em>, </span> where <span class="math"><em>ρ</em></span> is the radius of curvature at that point, and <span class="math"><em>n̂</em></span> is the unit normal vector to the curve at that point.</p>
