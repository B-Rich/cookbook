The 28th uniform polyhedron is the Dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol
3|2 5. Its dual is the icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (5,5,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: 2\
 Density: 1\
 Number of vertices: 20\
 Number of edges: 30\
 Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).

Its circumradius is
!['  (  the square root of (15) +  the square root of (3) ) / 4  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4258.1..png)
and its volume is
!['  ( 15 + 7  the square root of (5) ) /4  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4258.2..png)
if the edge length is 1.
