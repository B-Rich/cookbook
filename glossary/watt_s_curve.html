<p>Given two wheels, each with radius <span class="math"><em>b</em></span>, with their centres a distance <span class="math">2<em>a</em></span> apart, and a rod of length <span class="math">2<em>c</em></span> fixed to the circumference of one wheel at each end, then the locus of the midpoint of the rod as one of the wheels rotates is called Wattâ€™s curve. It has polar equation <br /><span class="math">$$r^2 = b^2 - [ a\sin( \theta ) \pm \sqrt{c^2 - a^2\cos^2\theta}]^2 .$$</span><br /></p>
