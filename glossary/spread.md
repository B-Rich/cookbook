Sometimes we are interested in how widely a random variable is spread
about its mean value. Two ways to measure this are the variance and the
standard deviation.

We could try to use the average value of
!['  X - \< X  \> ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3421.3..png) but
we find that this is always zero: \\

![' \< X - \< X \> \> =    the sum of  \_(i=1) \^( n) p\_(i) ( x  \_ (i) - \< X \> ) '](../dictionary/equation_images/3421.1..png)

\\

![' =  the sum of \_(i=1) \^( n) p\_(i)  x  \_ (i) -  the sum of \_(i=1) \^( n) p\_(i)   \< X \> = \< X \> - \< X \>   = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/3421.2..png)

Instead we use measures of spread such as the average squared difference
between X and its mean.
