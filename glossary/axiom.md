An assumption which is very basic, and very important to the theory
being developed. Usually mathematicians try to make a set of axioms for
a particular area, for instance Euclid's axioms of geometry; they try to
make this set as small as possible, and try to find axioms which are
obviously true.

Often a completely different theory can be worked out by changing one of
the axioms; for instance if Euclid's axiom about parallel lines is
changed, we get versions of geometry that work on the surface of a
sphere or a saddle, but not on a flat plane.
