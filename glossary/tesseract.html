<p>A four-dimensional object; it is analogous to a cube. The ’volume’ of a tesseract with edge length x is <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>4</sup>.</span></p>
<p>It has 16 vertices, 32 edges, 24 faces and 8 cells; the cells are cubes. Its dual is the 16-cell. It can be used to tessellate four-dimensional space.</p>
