<p>A test of the null hypothesis that k samples are taken from populations with the same mean. The populations are assumed to be normal and have a common unknown variance.</p>
<p>The distribution used is F with parameters k-1, n-k, where n is the total sample size. The test statistic is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\left ( \frac{\sum _i n_i ( \bar{x_i} - \bar{x} ) ^2}{k-1} \right ) }
{\left (  \frac{\sum _i \sum _j ( x_{ij} - \bar{x_i} ) ^2}{n-k} \right ) } ,$$</span><br /> where <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub></span> is the jth element of sample i, <span class="math">$ \bar{x_i} $</span> is the mean of sample i, <span class="math"><em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the size of sample i and <span class="math"><em>xÌ„</em></span> is the mean taken over all samples.</p>
