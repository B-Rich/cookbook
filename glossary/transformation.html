<p>A transformation of a geometric object like the plane is when we have a one-to-one mapping from S to S, where S is the set of points in the object.</p>
<p>Examples are rotations, reflections, enlargements and translations.</p>
<p>We can also have transformations which act upon algebraic objects, where there is a one-to-one mapping between sets of objects. We can have transformations of any kind of objects.</p>
