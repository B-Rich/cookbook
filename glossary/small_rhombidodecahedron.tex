The 44th uniform polyhedron is the Small rhombidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 5/2 5|. Its dual is the small rhombidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,4,10/9,4/3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -18\par
It is one-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  120\par
Number of faces: 42 (=6{10}and 15 quadrilaterals and 15{4/3}and 6{10/9}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
