To simplify a fraction is to divide top and bottom by any factors that
they have in common. For instance, in
!['  (2)/(6)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2847.1..png) the top and
bottom both have a factor of 2, so we can divide top and bottom by 2 to
get !['  (1)/(3) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2847.2..png)
