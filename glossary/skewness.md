A measure of how asymmetric a distribution is. There are several such
measures, but they share the feature that a long tail on the right is
called positive skewness and a long tail on the left is called negative
skewness. Skewness attempts to measure how much of the \\'weight\\' of
the distribution lies to the right of the mean.

The coefficient of skewness is
!['  //gamma \_1 = //mu \_3 / //mu \_2 \^(3/2) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2498.2..png)
where !['  //mu \_i  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2498.3..png) is
the i^th^ moment about the mean.

Other measures of skewness are:

(mean-mode)/(standard deviation);

\\

![' (Q\_3 - 2Q\_2 + Q\_1 )/(Q\_3 - Q\_1) , '](../dictionary/equation_images/2498.1..png)

where Q~1~, Q~2~ and Q~3~ are the first quartile, median and third
quartile respectively.
