<p>This is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways: <span class="math">1729 = 12<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> = 10<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup>.</span> Ramanujan famously pointed this out to Hardy.</p>
<p>It is also the third Carmichael number, and it is a Harshad number (divisible by the sum of its own digits).</p>
