An inflection point, or point of inflection, is a place on the graph of
a function, where the second derivative of the function is zero. It is a
place where the slope of the graph is not changing, and where the
tangent to the graph intersects the graph at that point. It is where the
graph\\'s curvature changes from positive to negative.

For instance, y = x^3^ + x^2^ + x + 1 has a point of inflection at
!['  x = - (1)/(3),  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2469.1..png)
because
!['   (d\^2 y)/(dx\^2) = 6 x + 2,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2469.2..png)
which is zero when
!['  x = - (1)/(3)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2469.3..png)
