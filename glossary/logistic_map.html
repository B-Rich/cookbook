<p>A mapping of the form <span class="math"><em>x</em> → <em>a</em><em>x</em>(1 − <em>x</em>)</span> for some constant <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> between <span class="math">0</span> and <span class="math">4</span>. As <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> changes, the properties of the map show bifurcation. This was the map in which the Feigenbaum number was discovered. The logistic map is used in some models of animal populations.</p>
