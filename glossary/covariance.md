A statistic which measures the agreement between two sets of data. For
variables X and Y, with means x and y, the covariance is
Cov(X,Y)=E(XY)-xy.

The covariance of two samples of equal size x~i~, y~i~ is:
!['  c\_(xy) =  the sum of  \_(i) (1)/(n)  ( x\_(i) - (bar)(x) )( y\_(i) -  (bar)(y) ) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3589.1..png)

Covariance depends on the scale used to make the measurements, unlike
correlation, which is another measure of the agreement between sets of
data.
