The number which does not change anything when you multiply by it.

The multiplicative identity.

It is the only integer that produces a greater result when added to a
number than when multiplied by it.

1 is the first square number, the first cube number...etc. It is also
the first triangular number, the first tetrahedral number; the first
number in very many patterns.

1 is not considered to be a prime number, because it has only one factor
(itself), and not two as other primes have.

It is both the first and the second Fibonacci number
