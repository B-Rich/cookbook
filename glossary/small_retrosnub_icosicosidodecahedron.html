<p>The 77th uniform polyhedron is the Small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |3/2 3/2 5/2. Its dual is the small hexagrammic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3/2,3,3/2,3,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -8</p>
<p>Density: 38</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 180</p>
<p>Number of faces: 112 (=60 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>and 40<span>3/2</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
