Of a function !['  f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20069.1..png) :

differentiable, with a continuous derivative;
!['  f  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20069.2..png) is said to be
!['   //mathcal(C)(r)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20069.3..png) if
it is !['  r  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20069.4..png) times
continuously differentiable.
