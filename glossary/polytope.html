<p>A polytope is a higher-dimensional analogue of a polyhedron.</p>
<p>In 2 dimensions there are infinitely many possible regular polygons;</p>
<p>In 3 dimensions there are 5 possible regular polyhedra;</p>
<p>In 4 dimensions there are 6 possible regular polytopes;</p>
<p>In each number of dimensions higher than 4, there are 3 possible regular polytopes, analogous to the three-dimensional tetrahedron, cube and octahedron.</p>
