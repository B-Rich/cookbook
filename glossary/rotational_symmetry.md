When a figure can be rotated so that it fits exactly onto its outline
more than once in a complete turn, it has rotational symmetry.

E.g. An equilateral triangle can be rotated about its centre and fitted
into its outline in three different ways, so it is said to have
rotational symmetry of order three.
