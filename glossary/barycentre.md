For a body made of of point masses m~i~ at positions (x~i~, y~i~, z~i~),
the centre of mass is at !['  (
(bar)(x),   (bar)(y), (bar)(z) )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2609.1..png)

where
!['  (bar)(x) = ( the sum of \_i x\_i m\_i)/( the sum of \_i m\_i),    etc.  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2609.2..png)

for a continuous body V with density p(x, y, z) at position (x, y, z)
and total mass M,

!['  (bar)(x) = ( the integral of \_V xpdx)/(M)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2609.3..png)

Roughly speaking, for a flat object the centre of mass is the place
where the object will balance; for a solid it is the point that will
always hang vertically below the point of suspension, when the object is
suspended from any point.
