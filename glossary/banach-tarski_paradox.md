Using the axiom of choice and the idea of non-measurable sets, we can
show that for the balls of radius 1 and 2, B(1) and B(2), there exist
sets such that:
!['  B(1)=C\_1 u C\_2 u ... u   C\_(n)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3086.1..png)

and
!['  B(2)=D\_1 u D\_2 u ... u   D\_(n)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3086.2..png)

and C~k~ is isometric to D~k~ for each value of k.

The sets are fractals; their volumes cannot be computed in the way that
an \\'ordinary\\' set\\'s could be.
