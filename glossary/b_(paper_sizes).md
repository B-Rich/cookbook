A certain set of paper sizes in common use for posters, charts, etc, are
called the B-series and designated B4, B5, etc. They are defined as
follows:

Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
!['  1 :  the square root of (2) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4120.1..png)
B0 has area
!['   the square root of (2) m\^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4120.2..png)
B1 half of this, B2 a quarter, etc. The A- and B- series of paper
together form a series in which each size has
!['  1 /  the square root of (2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4120.3..png)
the area of the previous size.

The B sizes are:

B0 = 1000 × 1414mm;\
 B1= 707 × 1000mm;\
 B2= 500 × 707mm;\
 B3= 353 × 500mm;\
 B4= 250 × 353mm;\
 B5= 176 × 250mm;\
 B6= 125 × 176mm;\
 B7= 88 × 125mm;\
 B8= 62 × 88mm;\
 B9= 44 × 62mm;\
 B10= 31 × 44mm.

Paper size B*n* has width 2^-n/2^m and height 2^1/2-n/2^m. The sizes are
rounded down to ensure that two B4 sheets are slightly smaller than one
B3 sheet, etc.

The height and width of B*n* paper are the geometric means of the
heights and widths of A*n* and A*n+1* papers.
