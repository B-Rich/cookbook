<p>For a sample of size n, in which value <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> occurs with frequency <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>,â€†</span> the sample variance is <br /><span class="math">$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x} ) ^2 f_i } {n}
 = \frac{\sum x_i ^2 f_i }{n} - \bar{x} ^2$$</span><br /></p>
<p>At a higher level, the sample variance is <br /><span class="math">$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x} ) ^2 f_i } {n-1} ,$$</span><br /> which is an unbiased estimate of the variance of the population from which the sample was taken.</p>
