 The impulse acting on a body (usually during a collision) is equal
to the change in momentum of the body.
\par
A constant force F acting for a time t causes an impulse
I=Ft.
\par
A variable force F causes an impulse $ \int F dt . $
\par
Impulse has dimensions $MLT^{-1}$  and SI unit Ns, Newton seconds.
