The following set of rules are called the rules of vector algebra:

addition: if **x**=(x~1~, x~2~, ... , x~n~) and **y**=(y~1~, y~2~, ... ,
y~n~), then **x**+**y**=(x~1~+y~1~, x~2~+y~2~, ... , x~n~+y~n~);

scalar multiplication: if **x**=(x~1~, x~2~, ... , x~n~) is a vector and
t is a scalar, then t**x**=(tx~1~, tx~2~, ... , tx~n~).

A closed set of objects obeying these rules is a vector space. A single
such object is a vector.
