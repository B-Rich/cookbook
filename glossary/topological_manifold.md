A topological manifold of dimension
!['  m  '](equation_images/20325.1..png) is a topological space
!['  M\^m  '](equation_images/20325.2..png) which is Hausdorff and
second countable, and is also locally homeomorphic to
!['   (R)\^m  '](equation_images/20325.3..png) . This means that every
point has an open neighbourhood homeomorphic with an open subset of
!['   (R)\^m  '](equation_images/20325.4..png) .
