<p>A test of the null hypothesis that the population mean has value <span class="math"><em>μ</em>.</span> The distribution used is N(0,1); the test statistic is <span class="math">$ \frac{ \bar{x} - \mu }{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} , $</span> where n is the sample size; if <span class="math"><em>σ</em></span> has to be estimated or the population is not normally distributed, then the test is approximate and a large sample should be taken.</p>
