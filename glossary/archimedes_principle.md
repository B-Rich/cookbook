The upthrust felt by a body placed in water is equal to the weight of
the water it displaces.

This means in particular that an object which floats displaces its own
weight of water, but an object which sinks displaces its own volume of
water.

There is a famous story about how this principle was discovered; a Greek
king in the time of Archimedes had a new crown made for himself, but he
wasn't sure that the goldsmiths had been honest with him. He suspected
that the crown wasn't gold all the way through; the craftsmen had kept
some of it for themselves, and used a less precious metal for parts of
the crown that weren't seen. But the king couldn't tell how to prove
anything, without taking the crown apart.

Archimedes realised that if the crown were placed in water, the volume
of water it displaced would be the same as the crown's volume. Knowing
the crown's volume, he would be able to work out its density (since he
already knew its weight), and so tell if it was the right density to be
gold. If it was more or less dense than pure gold, they would know that
the craftsmen had cheated them.

The story goes that Archimedes realised he could use the displacement of
water to solve the problem, while he was taking a bath in the public
baths. He was so pleased by his discovery that he leaped out of the bath
and ran home through the streets, shouting 'Eureka' - 'it is found'.
