Also called the mid-ordinate rule.

If the area under a curve y=f(x) is divided into vertical strips, then
the area of the strip between x=a and x=b is approximately equal to
!['  (b-a)f  ( (a+b)/(2)  ),  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2791.2..png)
ie the width of the strip multiplied by its length at its midpoint.

This can be extended into a rule for approximate numerical integration:
\\

!['  the integral of  \_a \^b y dx  approximately equals  h ( y\_(
(1)/(2) ) + y\_(1 (1)/(2) )   + ... + y\_(n- (1)/(2)
) ) , '](../dictionary/equation_images/2791.1..png)

where x~i~ divide [a,b] into n pieces of width h=(b-a)/n, with x~0~=a
and x~n~=b, and x~i+1/2~ are the midpoints of these pieces, and
y~k~=y(x~k~).
