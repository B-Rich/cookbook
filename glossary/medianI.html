<p>A way of taking an average value - it is way of describing something that is ’middling’.</p>
<p>Think of the heights of all the pupils in your class. Arrange them in order of size from smallest to tallest. The median height is the height of the person who is in the middle of this arrangement.</p>
<p>Any set of numbers or data can have a median value:</p>
<p>Consider the numbers: 4, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, 7 and 5; rearrange them in order:</p>
<p>0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7. The middle number - the median - is 3.</p>
<p>If there is an even amount of data then the median is half-way between the middle two values:</p>
<p>Consider the arranged numbers: 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6. The median is <span class="math">$ \frac{2+4}{2} = 3. $</span></p>
