<p>The standard error of a sample statistic is the standard deviation of the difference between that statistic and the corresponding population parameter. For example, if the statistic t is being used to estimate the parameter <span class="math"><em>τ</em>, </span> the standard error of t is the standard deviation of <span class="math"><em>t</em> − <em>τ</em>.</span></p>
<p>Unless we say otherwise, we are usually talking about the standard error of the sample mean, which for a sample of size n is <span class="math">$ \sigma / \sqrt{n} , $</span> where <span class="math"><em>σ</em></span> is the population standard deviation.</p>
<p>Confusingly, the estimated standard error is sometimes also called the ’standard error’.</p>
