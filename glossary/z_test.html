<p>A statistical test of the null hypothesis that a population parameter <span class="math"><em>μ</em></span> is equal to a given value <span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub>0</sub>.</span> We construct a z-statistic for the null hypothesis, i.e. a statistic which, under the null hypothesis, has mean zero and approximately a standard normal distribution. Then we accept the null hypothesis if z is less than <span class="math"><em>z</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> for a one tailed test with probability p, where <span class="math"><em>z</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> is the pth percentile of the standard normal distribution.</p>
