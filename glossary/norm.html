<p>A norm on a vector space is:</p>
<p>A mapping from elements of the vector space to the real numbers; it is positive for every element of the space, and zero only for the zero element. The norm of element v is denoted ||v||</p>
<p>If n is a real number, then ||nv||=|n|.||v||</p>
<p><span class="math">$ \\| u+v \\| \leq \\| u \\| + \\| v \\| , $</span> for all u and v in the space.</p>
<p>A norm may be used to define a metric: d(x,y)=||x-y||.</p>
<p>A norm on a matrix is a norm on the vector space of matrices.</p>
