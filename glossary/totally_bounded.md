Of a metric space : having the property that, given
!['   //varepsilon \>0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20330.1..png) ,
we can find finitely many open balls of radius
!['   //varepsilon   '](../dictionary/equation_images/20330.2..png) that
cover the space. In a complete metric space this is equivalent to saying
that the space is sequentially compact or just compact.
