<p>A type of plane geometrical transformation. The perspective affinity defined by line l, direction d and ratio r operates as follows:</p>
<p>Given a point P, draw a line from P in direction d to meet l at X. Find P’ such that P’X/PX=r. Then P’ is the image of P under the transformation.</p>
<p>Isometries, similarities, shears and stretches are all kinds of perspective affinity.</p>
<p>The composition of one or more perspective affinities is called a general affinity.</p>
