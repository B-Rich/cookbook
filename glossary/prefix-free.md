A string !['  x  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.1..png) is a
prefix in another string
!['  y  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.2..png) if
!['  y=xz  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.3..png) for some
string !['  z  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.4..png) . A
prefix-free code is one in which no codeword is a prefix in another.
Note that every prefix-free code is decipherable, but the converse is
not true. For example, taking the source alphabet to be
!['   //(1,2,3 //)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.5..png) and
!['  f(1)=1  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.6..png) ,
!['  f(2)=01  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.7..png) ,
!['  f(3)=001  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20260.8..png) gives a
decipherable code that is not prefix-free. See also Kraft inequality.
