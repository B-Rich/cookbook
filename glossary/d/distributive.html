<p>The expression <span class="math">5 × (3 + 6)</span> could be calculated in two ways. One way of calculating it is <span class="math">5 × 9</span>, working out the brackets first, and giving the answer <span class="math">45</span>.</p>
<p>Another way of calculating it could be <span class="math">(5 × 3) + (5 × 6)</span> i.e multiplying everything inside the brackets by <span class="math">5</span>, which gives <span class="math">15 + 30</span>, an answer of <span class="math">45</span>.</p>
<p>This demosntrates the fact that multiplication is <em>distributive</em> over addition.</p>
