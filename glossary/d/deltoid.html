<p>The envelope traced out by Simsonâ€™s line for a given triangle, as we move through all possible points on the circumcircle.</p>
<p>It has parametric equations: x=2a.cos(t)+a.cos(2t), y=2a.sin(t)-a.sin(2t).</p>
<p>It is also the hypocycloid made by a circle of radius a rolling inside a circle of radius 3a.</p>
