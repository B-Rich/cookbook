<p>In one dimension: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{t}}
= \kappa \frac{\partial ^2 \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x} ^2 }$$</span><br /> where t is time, x is a space coordinate and <span class="math"><em>Îº</em></span> is a constant of diffusivity (always positive for physical problems).</p>
