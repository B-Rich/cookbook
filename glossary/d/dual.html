<p>- Let <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> be a vector space over <span class="math">F</span> . The dual of <span class="math"><em>V</em></span> , written <span class="math"><em>V</em><sup> * </sup></span> , is the set of all linear maps <span class="math"><em>f</em> : <em>V</em> → F</span> . The operations of addition and scalar multiplication are defined in the obvious pointwise manner.</p>
<p>- The dual of a set is the set of continuous linear maps <span class="math"><em>f</em> : <em>E</em> → C</span> . Note that <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> is continuous iff it is bounded. Such maps are therefore bounded linear functionals.</p>
