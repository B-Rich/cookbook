The 46th uniform polyhedron is the Ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|5/3 5. Its dual is the medial triambic icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/3,5,5/3,5,5/3,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -16\par
Density: 4\par
Number of vertices: 20\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 24 (=12 pentagons and 12{5/3}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
