An expression derived from an equation, which gives us some
information about the solutions of the equation.\par

For instance, the discriminant for a quadratic equation: $ax^{2}$  + bx + c = 0 is:\par

d = $b^{2}$  - 4ac.\par

If d is positive, the equation has two solutions;
if d = 0 there is one solution and if d is negative
there are no real solutions.
