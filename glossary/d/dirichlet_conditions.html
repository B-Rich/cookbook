<p>Sufficiency conditions for a ‘well-behaved’ periodic function <span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> with period <span class="math">2<em>L</em></span> to have a convergent Fourier series. These are that <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> must be bounded and have a finite number of maxima, minima and discontinuities for <span class="math"><em>x</em> ∈ [0, 2<em>L</em>)</span> ; then the Fourier series will converge to <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> wherever it is continuous, and at a jump discontinuity it will converge to the midpoint of the two one-sided limits. Not that these are not necessary conditions, for example <span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>s</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(1/<em>x</em>)</span> does have a convergent Fourier series.</p>
