An equation in which trigonometric functions of the variable are used.

Such equations often have infinitely many solutions, because the
trigonometric functions are periodic, so for instance sin(x) = 0 has
solutions at x =
!['  n //pi  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2670.1..png) for any
integer n.
