<p>Given a rectangular hyperbola, choose a point P on it. Draw a tangent to the hyperbola at P. Draw a line perpendicular to the tangent, through the origin. Call the point where this line intersects the tangent, Q. The locus of Q is called a lemniscate.</p>
<p>This curve has an equation of the form: <span class="math">(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> = <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>).</span></p>
<p>In polar coordinates, it has equation <span class="math">r<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup>cos2<em>θ</em>.</span></p>
<p>It is the envelope of the circles whose centres lie on a given rectangular hyperbola and which pass through the hyperbola’s centre.</p>
<p>It is the inverse of the hyperbola with respect to its centre.</p>
<p>It is a special case of Cassini’s ovals.</p>
