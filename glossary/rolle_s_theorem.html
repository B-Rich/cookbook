<p>If f(x) is continuous in the region <span class="math">a ≤ x ≤ b,</span> differentiable in the region <span class="math">a &lt; x &lt; b,</span> and f(a)=f(b), then there is a point between a and b at which <span class="math">$ \frac{\mathrm{df}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 0 ,$</span> i.e. there is a place where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.</p>
