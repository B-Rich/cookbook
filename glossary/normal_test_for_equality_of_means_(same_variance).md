A special case of the test for a given difference in the means: Given
two distributions with the same known variance
!['  //sigma \^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1832.2..png) this
is a test of the null hypothesis that they have the same mean. We have
two samples x~i~ and y~i~ of sizes m and n. The distribution used is
N(0,1); the test statistic is \\
![' ( (bar)(x) - (bar)(y) )/  ( //sigma  the square root of  (
(1)/(m) + (1)/(n) ) ) . '](../dictionary/equation_images/1832.1..png)
If the two distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has
to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be
used.
