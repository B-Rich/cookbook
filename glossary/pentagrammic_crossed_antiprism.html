<p>The 5th uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic crossed antiprism; it has Wythoff symbol |2 2 5/3. Its dual is the pentagrammic concave deltohedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,5/3); its symmetry group is the dihedral group D5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 3</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 10</p>
<p>Number of edges: 20</p>
<p>Number of faces: 12 (=10 triangles and 2<span>5/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
