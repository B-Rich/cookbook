<p>A measure of how asymmetric a distribution is. There are several such measures, but they share the feature that a long tail on the right is called positive skewness and a long tail on the left is called negative skewness. Skewness attempts to measure how much of the ’weight’ of the distribution lies to the right of the mean.</p>
<p>The coefficient of skewness is <span class="math"><em>γ</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>μ</em><sub>3</sub>/<em>μ</em><sub>2</sub><sup>3/2</sup>, </span> where <span class="math"><em>μ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is the <span class="math"><em>i</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> moment about the mean.</p>
<p>Other measures of skewness are:</p>
<p>(mean-mode)/(standard deviation);</p>
<p><br /><span class="math">$$\frac{Q_3 - 2Q_2 + Q_1 }{Q_3 - Q_1} ,$$</span><br /> where <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>1</sub>, </span> <span class="math"><em>Q</em><sub>2</sub><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>Q</em><sub>3</sub></span> are the first quartile, median and third quartile respectively.</p>
