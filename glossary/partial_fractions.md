If we take a fraction A, and write it as the sum of a set of fractions
whose denominators are factors of the denominator of A, then the set of
fractions is called a set of partial fractions.

For example, if we write
!['  (1)/(6) = (1)/(2) - (1)/(3)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/422.1..png)
then !['  (1)/(2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/422.2..png) and
!['  - (1)/(3)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/422.3..png) are called
partial fractions.
