<p>The iterated mapping <span class="math"><em>z</em> ↦ <em>z</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>k</em></span> has a strange attractor for certain values of k. This attractor is called a Julia set.</p>
<p>For other values of k the mapping goes to infinity or to a fixed point. Values of k for which the mapping does not go to infinity are said to lie in the Mandelbrot set.</p>
<p>If the starting point of the mapping lies in this Mandelbrot set, then the Julia set will be a connected set. Otherwise it will be disconnected dust, called Fatou dust.</p>
<p>Other mappings may be used, for instance <span class="math"><em>z</em> ↦ <em>a</em>cos<em>z</em> + <em>k</em>; </span> the strange attractors of these mappings are also called Julia sets, though they do not have the same connection with the Mandelbrot set.</p>
