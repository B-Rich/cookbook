<p>Of a given field, a field containing it.</p>
<p>Write <span class="math"><em>L</em>/<em>K</em></span> to mean “L extends K”; we say that <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> is a finite extension if its dimension as a vector space over <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> is finite. If it is also separable, then in fact <span class="math"><em>L</em> = <em>K</em>(<em>α</em>)</span> for some <span class="math"><em>α</em> ∈ <em>L</em></span> (the theorem of the primitive element). The field <span class="math"><em>K</em></span> may be referred to as the base field of <span class="math"><em>L</em></span> .</p>
