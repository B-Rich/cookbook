A mapping from a set onto itself, that preserves all algebraic
operations that are allowed on that set (so for instance if A=BC+D
before the mapping is applied, then it is still true afterwards).

An automorphism is an isomorphism from a set onto itself.

The set of all automorphisms on a particular set, together with the
operation of composition of mappings, forms a group.
