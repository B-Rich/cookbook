A computer language.

Using instructions such as 'forward 40' `(FD 40)`, 'backward 20'
`(BK 20)`, 'right 85' `(RT 85)` or 'left 125' `(LT 125)`, drawings can
be constructed.

The language gets more complicated as new instructions(called
primitives), are created, allowing more complicated geometric drawings
to be constructed and lists compiled.
