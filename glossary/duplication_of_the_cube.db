The ancient problem which asks that from a given cube we
construct a new cube with twice the volume of the original.
This is to be solved using only compasses and straightedge.
\par
It is impossible.
\par
It would be equivalent to constructing a line of length
$ \sqrt[3]{2} , $ and it can be shown that cube roots
cannot be constructed geometrically, only square roots.
\par
The conchoid of Nicomedes and the cissoid of Diocles
were both invented to help solve this problem (both of them 
break the rule about only using compasses and straightedge,
as do solutions involving the intersections of conics, etc).
