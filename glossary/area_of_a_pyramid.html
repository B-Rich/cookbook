<p>A pyramid whose base is a regular <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>-sided polygon, whose apex is directly above the centre of the base, has total surface area <span class="math"><em>n</em><em>A</em> + <em>B</em></span>, where <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> is the area of one of the slanting faces, and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> is the area of the base.</p>
<p>The area of a regular n-gon is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{1}{4} x^2 n \tan (90 - \frac{180}{n} ) ,$$</span><br /> where <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> is the length of one of its edges - so this is the area of the base.</p>
<p>And the face height of a pyramid is <br /><span class="math">$$f = \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{1}{4} x^2 \tan ^2 (90 - \frac{180}{n} ) } ,$$</span><br /> where <span class="math"><em>h</em></span> is the height of the pyramid.</p>
<p>So each face has area <span class="math"><em>x</em><em>f</em>/2</span> (half base <span class="math"> × </span> height).</p>
<p>Putting all of these pieces together, the total area of the pyramid is: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{n}{2}x \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{1}{4} x^2 \tan ^2 \theta }
+ \frac{1}{4} x^2 n \tan \theta ,$$</span><br /> where <span class="math">$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n}. $</span></p>
