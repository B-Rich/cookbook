28 is a happy number because:

28 -\> 2² + 8² = 4 + 64 = 68

68 -\> 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100

100 -\> 1² + 0² + 0² = 1

Twenty eight can be reduced to 1 by the process of repeatedly squaring
and adding the digits. Thirty two is also a happy number:

32 -\> 3² + 2² = 9 + 4 = 13

13 -\> 1² + 3² = 1 + 9 = 10

10 -\> 1² + 0² = 1 + 0 = 1

But 24 is a sad, unhappy number. Can you see why?
