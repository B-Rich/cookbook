This is a test of the null hypothesis that two samples drawn from similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the \emph{same} distribution, against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different locations.
\par
The sample statistic is $W$, equal to the sum of ranks of the
smaller sample. Tables are given for use with this test.
