<p>Work is the integral of force with respect to position, or the integral of energy with respect to time.</p>
<p>If f(x) is the force exerted on a particle when it is at position x, then the work done by this force as the particle moves along a given path is the integral of f.dx along that path.</p>
<p>Work has dimensions <span class="math"><em>M</em><em>L</em><sup>2</sup><em>T</em><sup> − 2</sup></span> and SI unit J.</p>
