<p>In one dimension, <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{1}{{c}^2} \frac{\partial ^2 {f}}{\partial {t}^2}
= \frac{\partial ^2 {f}}{\partial {x} ^2 }$$</span><br /> where t is time and x is a space co-ordinate. c is the wave speed. This equation describes, for instance, the displacement of a vibrating string at different positions along its length and at different times.</p>
