A special kind of Taylor series, of the form:
f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)x+f''(0)x^2^/2+f'''(0)x^3^/3!+...
+f^(n-1)^(0)x^n-1^/(n-1)!+R~n~.

(This is a Taylor series with a=0.)

Maclaurin's theorem states the conditions under which such a series
exists for a function f.

R~n~ is a remainder term, and can be written in the same forms as that
of a Taylor series.
