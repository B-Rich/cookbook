The interior of a set
!['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.1..png) , written
!['  A\^0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.2..png) is the union
of all open subsets of
!['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.3..png) ; a point
!['  b  is a member of  A\^0  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.4..png)
iff some neighbourhood of
!['  b  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.5..png) is a subset of
!['  A  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20173.6..png) . The interior of
a set is open. Compare boundary.
