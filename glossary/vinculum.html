<p>Sometimes we draw a line over the top of a group of symbols, meaning the same thing as a pair of brackets round those symbols. This is called a vinculum. Eg: <br /><span class="math">$${a} + \bar{{b + c}} = {a + (b + c)}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>The word is also sometimes used to mean the horizontal bar in a fraction.</p>
