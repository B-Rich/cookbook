<p>The hypothesis that the Riemann zeta function <span class="math"><em>ζ</em>(s) = ∑<sub>n = 1</sub><sup>∞</sup>n<sup> − s</sup></span> is equal to zero only when s (which is a complex number) is equal to -2k for some natural number k, or when the real part of s is 1/2.</p>
<p>This has not been proved, although it has been shown that there are infinitely many values of s with real part equal to 1/2 for which the Riemann zeta function is equal to zero.</p>
