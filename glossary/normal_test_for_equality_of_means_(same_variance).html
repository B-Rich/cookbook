<p>A special case of the test for a given difference in the means: Given two distributions with the same known variance <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> this is a test of the null hypothesis that they have the same mean. We have two samples <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> and <span class="math"><em>y</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> of sizes m and n. The distribution used is N(0,1); the test statistic is <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{ \bar{x} - \bar{y} }
{ \sigma \sqrt {\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} } } .$$</span><br /> If the two distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has to be estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be used.</p>
