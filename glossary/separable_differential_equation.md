A differential equation is called separable if it can be written as a
function of x, plus a function of y multiplied by
!['  (dy)/(dx),  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2911.3..png) equals
zero: \\
![' p(x) + q(y)  ( (dy)/(dx)  )  = 0 '](../dictionary/equation_images/2911.1..png)
In this case the equation can be written: \\
![' p(x)dx = -q(y)dy '](../dictionary/equation_images/2911.2..png)
and we can then integrate both sides.
