The 28th uniform polyhedron is the Dodecahedron; it has Wythoff 
symbol 3|2 5. Its dual is the icosahedron. The pattern of polygons 
round each vertex is (5,5,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral 
group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: 2\par
Density: 1\par
Number 
of vertices: 20\par
Number of edges:  30\par
Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).
\par
Its circumradius is $ ( \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{3} ) / 4 $
and its volume is $ ( 15 + 7 \sqrt{5} ) /4 $ if the edge length is 1.
