<p>If something is quadratic, it contains the variable squared, but not raised to any higher power. For instance a quadratic equation in x contains <span class="math"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>b</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>t</em><em>x</em><sup>3</sup>.</span> Similarly a quadratic expression, or a quadratic form, contains its variable(s) squared but not raised to any higher power.</p>
<p>If there is more than one variable, quadratic can mean that they are multiplied together in pairs but not in threes.</p>
