A number associated with a polyhedron. For a Platonic solid, it is
written {p, q}, where p is the number of sides each face has, and q is
the number of faces which touch at each vertex.

Given this information, the number of vertices is:
!['  (4 p)/(4-(p-2)(q-2)
) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4212.1..png)

The number of edges is: !['  (2 pq)/(4-(p-2)(q-2)
) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4212.2..png)

And the number of faces is: !['  (4 q)/(4-(p-2)(q-2)
) .  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4212.3..png)
