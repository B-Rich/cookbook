<p>Given a triangle ABC, we can construct the outscribed circle as follows:</p>
<p>Draw the perpendicular bisector of AB;</p>
<p>Draw the perpendicular bisector of BC;</p>
<p>Label the point of intersection of these two bisectors, D;</p>
<p>Use compasses to draw a circle with centre D, which passes through A. It will also pass through B and C, so it is the outscribed circle of triangle ABC.</p>
