A square matrix A for which
!['  (bar)(A)\^(T) . A = I  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3709.1..png)
where !['  (bar)(M)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3709.2..png) means
the matrix whose elements are the complex conjugates of those of M. (If
the elements of A are real numbers, then A is an orthogonal matrix.)
