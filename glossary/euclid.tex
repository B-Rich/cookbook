Euclid:
\par
A Greek mathematician(born c. 300BC) famous for his work on Geometry, especially his book called \emph{The Elements}.
He devised a geometry dealing with points, lines and planes based on some specific assumptions,  that:
\begin{itemize}
\item a line can go through any two points  
\item a line can be extended indefinitely in both directions
\item all right angles are equal
\item one line only can be drawn parallel to a given line through a point not on the line.
\end{itemize}
