$$cosec\theta=\frac{1}{\sin\theta}$$
\par
In a right-angled triangle, if one of the angles is $\theta$, then
the cosecant of $\theta$ is the length of the hypotenuse
divided by the length of the side opposite $\theta$. 
\par
In other words, $cosec\theta = \frac{\mbox{hypoteneuse}}{\mbox{opposite}}$.
