A sequence u~n~ with the property that u~i~+u~i+1~=u~i+2~ for every i.

Usually we also require that u~0~=u~1~=1.

The sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55

The numbers in this sequence are called Fibonacci numbers, and the
equation defining the sequence is called the Fibonacci equation.
