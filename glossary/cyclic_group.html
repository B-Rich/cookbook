<p>A group which is generated by a single element is called cyclic. For instance, the group of rotations through multiples of <span class="math">90<sup> ∘ </sup></span> can be generated from the single element which is a single clockwise rotation of <span class="math">90<sup> ∘ </sup></span>. The other rotations are produced by repeating this rotation.</p>
<p>The single element is called a generator for the group.</p>
<p>A cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo n under addition.</p>
