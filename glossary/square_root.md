The square root of a given number is that number which when multiplied
by itself gives the original number. \\'The square root of x\\' is
written
!['   the square root of  (x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/208.1..png)

e.g. The square root of nine is three or minus three:
!['   the square root of  (9) = (+/-) 3  '](../dictionary/equation_images/208.2..png)\
 The square root of twenty five is five or minus five
!['   the square root of  (25) = (+/-) 5  '](../dictionary/equation_images/208.3..png)
