<p>For any set <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> there is a function <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> with the property that if <span class="math"><em>X</em></span> is a nonempty subset of <span class="math"><em>S</em></span>, then <span class="math"><em>f</em>(<em>X</em>)</span> is in <span class="math"><em>X</em></span>. This means that <span class="math"><em>f</em></span> (called the ’choice function’) effectively chooses an element from the set on which it acts. This axiom is independent of and consistent with the other axioms of set theory, but is often thought to be counterintuitive (in this respect it is like the parallel postulate in geometry).</p>
