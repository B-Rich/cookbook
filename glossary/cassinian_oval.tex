Given two points A and B and a constant $c^{2},$  the locus of points P
with $PA.PB=c^{2}$  is called Cassini's ovals.
\par
The locus has equation $(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}-2a^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})^{2}-a^{4}+c^{4}=0,$ 
where a=AB.
\par
This is the same set of curves as the cross-sections of a
circular torus taken parallel to its axis.
\par
If c=a, then the curve is a lemniscate.
