<p>A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper, bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.</p>
<p>The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, i.e. <span class="math">$ 1 : \sqrt{2} , $</span> and RA0 size has area <span class="math">1.05<em>m</em><sup>2</sup>, </span> RA1 half this, etc. So the sizes are:</p>
<p>RA0= 860 <span class="math"> × </span> 1220 mm;</p>
<p>RA1= 610 <span class="math"> × </span> 860 mm;</p>
<p>RA2= 430 <span class="math"> × </span> 610 mm;</p>
<p>RA3= 305 <span class="math"> × </span> 430 mm;</p>
<p>RA4= 215 <span class="math"> × </span> 305 mm.</p>
