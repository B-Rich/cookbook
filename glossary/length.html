<p>A measurement of the distance between two points. The distance can be measured along a straight line or a curved path. What we mean by <em>straight</em> or <em>curved</em> is very much dependent on the kind of geometry we are using. Common tools for measuring length are the ruler, metre stick, trundle wheel or a tape measure. In the past, the lengths of body parts were used to estimate length - giving us such useful units as the <em>foot</em> and the <em>hand</em>.</p>
