For a contingency table with r rows and c columns, and expected
frequency of each cell at least 5, this is a test for the null
hypothesis that the row and column classifications are independent. The
distribution used is
!['  //chi \^2  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1821.1..png) with
(r-1)(c-1) degrees of freedom; the test statistic is !['   the sum of  (
(f\_o - f\_e ) \^2 )/ (f\_e) ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/1821.2..png)
where f~e~ is the expected distribution and f~o~ the observed function.
