<p>The 48th uniform polyhedron is the Small ditrigonal dodecicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 3|5. Its dual is the small ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,5/3,10,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: -16</p>
<p>Density: 4</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 60</p>
<p>Number of edges: 120</p>
<p>Number of faces: 44 (=12<span>10</span>and 20 triangles and 12<span>5/3</span>).</p>
<p>Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every <span class="math"><em>b</em><sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.</p>
