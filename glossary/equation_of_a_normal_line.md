Given a surface g(x,y,z)=k and a point A with position vector **a** on
this surface, the normal line to the surface at A has equation
!['  r = a + //lambda  //nabla g  | \_a ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2019.1..png)
where !['  //lambda  '](../dictionary/equation_images/2019.2..png) is a
scalar parameter.
