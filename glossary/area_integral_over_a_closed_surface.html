<p>The integral of vector area over the whole of a closed surface is zero: <br /><span class="math">∫<sub>S</sub>dS = ∫<sub>S</sub>dSn = 0</span><br /> where S is a closed surface and <strong>n</strong> is the normal to that surface at any point; dS is scalar area and <strong>dS</strong> is vector area.</p>
