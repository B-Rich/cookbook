A measure of spread of a distribution. It is equal to the mean of the
squared distance of the variable from its mean: \\

![' Var(x) =   (1)/(n)  the sum of  \_(x) ( x - (bar)(x) ) \^2 , '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.1..png)

where n is the number of possible values of x, and
!['  (bar)(x)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.2..png) means the
mean of x.

It is often written
!['  //sigma \^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.3..png) where
!['  //sigma  '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.4..png) is the
standard deviation.

It can be shown that the variance of X is equal to
!['  (bar)(x\^2) - ( (bar)(x)
)\^2 ,  '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.5..png) where
!['  (bar)(x\^2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/693.6..png) means the
mean of x^2^.
