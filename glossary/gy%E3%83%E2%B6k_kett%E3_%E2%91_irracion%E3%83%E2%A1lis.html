<p><span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} $</span> is irrational.</p>
<p>Justification: If <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} $</span> were rational we could write <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} = \frac{\mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{q}} $</span> with p, q integers having no common factors. But then we have <span class="math">$ 2 = \frac{\mathrm{p}^2}{\mathrm{q}^2} $</span> by squaring both sides, and <span class="math">2<em>q</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
<p>The left hand side has a factor of 2, so the right hand side must also have a factor of 2, so p must be divisible by 2, i.e. we can write p=2r. Then we have <span class="math">2<em>q</em><sup>2</sup> = 4<em>r</em><sup>2</sup><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>q</em><sup>2</sup> = 2<em>r</em><sup>2</sup>.</span> This means that q must have a factor of 2. So p and q have a common factor of 2, which contradicts our assumption that p and q have no common factors. So we conclude that we cannot write <span class="math">$ \sqrt{2} $</span> as a fraction, so it is irrational.</p>
