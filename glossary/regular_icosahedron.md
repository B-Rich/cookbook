The 27th uniform polyhedron is the Icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol
5|2 3. Its dual is the dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (3,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:\
 Euler characteristic: 2\
 Density: 1\
 Number of vertices: 12\
 Number of edges: 30\
 Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).

Its circumradius is
!['   the square root of  ( 10 + 2  the square root of  (5)
) / 4  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4257.1..png) and its volume is
!['  5(3+  the square root of (5) ) / 12  '](../dictionary/equation_images/4257.2..png)
if its edge length is 1.
