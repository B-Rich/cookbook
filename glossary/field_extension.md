Of a given field, a field containing it.

Write !['  L/K  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.1..png) to mean
\`\`L extends K\\'\\'; we say that
!['  L  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.2..png) is a finite
extension if its dimension as a vector space over
!['  K  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.3..png) is finite. If it
is also separable, then in fact
!['  L=K( //alpha )  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.4..png) for
some
!['   //alpha   is a member of  L  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.5..png)
(the theorem of the primitive element). The field
!['  K  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.6..png) may be referred
to as the base field of
!['  L  '](../dictionary/equation_images/20126.7..png) .
