<p>Probability measures how likely an event or outcome is.</p>
<p>It is usually shown as a success fraction - the number of ways an event could happen compared to the total number of events that could happen - and is written: <br /><span class="math">$$\text{probability(of special event)} = 
\frac{\text{(No of times that special event occurs)}}
{\text{(Total number of events occurring)}}$$</span><br /></p>
