<p>If we differentiate an implicit equation without first making it explicit, this is called an implicit differentiation. Very often we have to use the product rule in order to do this.</p>
<p>For example: <span class="math">xy = 2</span></p>
<p>Differentiate with respect to x, using the product rule: <span class="math">$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}} (\mathrm{xy}) = 0 $</span> <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{dx}} \mathrm{y} + \mathrm{x} \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 0$$</span><br /> <br /><span class="math">$$\mathrm{y} + \mathrm{x} \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 0$$</span><br /></p>
