A set F with two commutative and associative operations, 
+ and \ensuremath{ \times ,} such that:
\par
1)if a and b are in F then a+b and \ensuremath{a \times b} are in F;
\par
2)+ has an identity, 0, and \ensuremath{ \times } has an identity, 1, and
these are not the same;
\par
3)every element has an inverse under +, and every element but
0 has an inverse under \ensuremath{ \times ;}
\par
\ensuremath{4) \times } is distributive over +.
\par
 $ \mathbb {Q,R,C} $ are all fields with the operations of addition 
and multiplication.
\par
The definition can also be written: F is a commutative group under 
addition; F/{0} is a commutative group under multiplication; 
multiplication is distributive over addition.
