A sequence $u_{n}$  with the property that $u_{i}+u_{i+1}=u_{i+2}$  for every i.
\par
Usually we also require that $u_{0}=u_{1}=1.$ 
\par
The sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
\par
The numbers in this sequence are called Fibonacci numbers,
and the equation defining the sequence is called the Fibonacci equation.
