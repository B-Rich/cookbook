<p>A simple harmonic system is called forced if it is subject to a force whose size varies sinusoidally over time. It is described by the equation <span class="math">$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega ^2 x = a \omega ^2 \sin ( \Omega t ) $</span> (undamped)</p>
<p>or <span class="math">$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \alpha \frac{dx}{dt} + \omega ^2 x
= a \omega ^2 \sin ( \Omega t ) $</span> (damped).</p>
<p>If <span class="math">Ω = <em>ω</em>, </span> resonance occurs, and in the case of undamped motion the amplitude of the oscillations will grow without limit.</p>
