<p>If we are given a set of fractions a/b, c/d, e/f, ... we can find a common denominator for them by multiplying together the denominators b, d, f, ...</p>
<p>Eg for 3/4, 4/5, 5/6 have common denominator <span class="math">4 × 5 × 6 = 120</span>.</p>
<p>This is not the lowest common denominator, as 60 is a multiple of 4, 5 and 6.</p>
