<p>A set F with two commutative and associative operations, + and <span class="math"> × , </span> such that:</p>
<p>1)if a and b are in F then a+b and <span class="math"><em>a</em> × <em>b</em></span> are in F;</p>
<p>2)+ has an identity, 0, and <span class="math"> × </span> has an identity, 1, and these are not the same;</p>
<p>3)every element has an inverse under +, and every element but 0 has an inverse under <span class="math"> × ; </span></p>
<p><span class="math">4) × </span> is distributive over +.</p>
<p><span class="math">Q,R,C</span> are all fields with the operations of addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>The definition can also be written: F is a commutative group under addition; F/<span>0</span> is a commutative group under multiplication; multiplication is distributive over addition.</p>
