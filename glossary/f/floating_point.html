<p>A method of representing numbers, widely used in computing, using two sequences of digits - the significant digits of the number, and the position of the radix point. A number <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> is represented as <span class="math"><em>N</em> = <em>r</em> × <em>b</em><sup><em>e</em></sup></span>, where <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> is a real number, usually constrained to be within a range (often <span class="math">[1/<em>b</em>, 1]</span>), and <span class="math"><em>b</em></span> is the base of the representation (an integer), and <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> is another integer. <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> is called the mantissa, and <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> the exponent. For example, 365.24 can be represented as <span class="math">0.36524 × 10<sup>3</sup></span> - scientific notation is special case of floating-point notation with base 10. In computing the base 2 is often used, and <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> must lie in a given range, and <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> is constrained to have a particular number of digits. This means that when numbers are multiplied, etc, rounding errors can occur due to the extra digits of <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> being discarded.</p>
