<p>A real number, also called just a real, is a number which can be written out as a decimal, even though it might take forever to do so.</p>
<p>We use the symbol <span class="math">R</span> for the set of all real numbers <span class="math"><em>x</em> = <em>k</em>.<em>x</em><sub>1</sub><em>x</em><sub>2</sub><em>x</em><sub>3</sub>...</span> where k is an integer and each of the <span class="math"><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> is one of the digits 0, 1, ...9.</p>
<p>Whole numbers, fractions, irrational and transcendental numbers are all real.</p>
