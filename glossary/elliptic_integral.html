<p>An integral of the form <br /><span class="math">$$\int \mathrm{f} ( \mathrm{x}, \sqrt{\mathrm{R}} ) \mathrm{dx} ,$$</span><br /> where R is a cubic or a quartic in x, and f is a rational functionof its two arguments.</p>
<p>Any elliptic integral can be written as a sum of multiples of an elementary function, and the three standard types of elliptic integral.</p>
<p>These integral were first used in finding the circumference of an ellipse.</p>
