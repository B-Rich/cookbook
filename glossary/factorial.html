<p>A shorthand way of writing down a special whole number:</p>
<p>Four factorial or Factorial four is written 4! and means <br /><span class="math">4 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 1</span><br />, which equals 24</p>
<p>Six factorial 6! = 720.</p>
<p>Factorials grow very quickly: 1! = 1; 2! = 2; 3! = 6; 4! = 24; 5! = 120; 6! = 720; 7! = 5040; 8! = 40320; 9! = 362880</p>
<p>(0 is special; 0!=1, not zero as you might expect.)</p>
