The 77th uniform polyhedron is the Small retrosnub icosicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |3/2 3/2 5/2. Its dual is the small hexagrammic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3/2,3,3/2,3,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
Density: 38\par
Number of vertices: 60\par
Number of edges:  180\par
Number of faces: 112 (=60 triangles and 12{5/2}and 40{3/2}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
