The 70th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahemicosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|3. Its dual is the great dodecahemicosacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,5/4,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.\par
It has:\par
Euler characteristic: -8\par
It is one-sided; it has\par
Number of vertices: 30\par
Number of edges:  60\par
Number of faces: 22 (=10 hexagons and 6 pentagons and 6{5/4}).\par
Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining every $b^{th}$  of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made by taking five points and joining every second point.
