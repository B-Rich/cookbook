<p>If frequency F is plotted against rank i, the relationship between the two is of the form <span class="math"><em>F</em> ∼ 1/<em>i</em><sup><em>a</em></sup>, </span> with a close to 1; i.e. there is a power-law relationship. This law holds for many naturally-occurring populations; for example the frequency distribution of words in texts.</p>
