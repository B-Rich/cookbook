<p>This is a system of differential equations which can be used to model the variation of two populations of animals (predators and prey) over time: <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{gx-kxy}$$</span><br /> <br /><span class="math">$$\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{ckxy-dy} ,$$</span><br /></p>
<p>where x is the size of the prey population;</p>
<p>y is the size of the predator population;</p>
<p>g is the rate of growth of the prey population (as a fraction of the existing population, per unit time);</p>
<p>k is the rate at which the predators kill the prey (kills per predator per prey animal per unit time);</p>
<p>c represents the number of prey that must be consumed to make a new predator;</p>
<p>is the death rate of the predator (as a proportion of the existing population, per unit time).</p>
