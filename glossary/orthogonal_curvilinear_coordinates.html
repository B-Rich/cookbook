<p>A coordinate system for <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> -dimensional space defined by specifying <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> orthogonal vectors, which are in general functions of position. Given these vectors, the components of a given point are the calculated in the usual manner. Common examples are Cartesian coordinates, cylindrical polar coordinates and spherical polar coordinates.</p>
