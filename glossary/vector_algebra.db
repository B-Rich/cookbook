
\newcommand{\v}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
The following set of rules are called the rules of vector algebra:
\begin{description}
\item[addition:] if $\v{x}=(x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{n})$ 
and $\v{y}=(y_{1}, y_{2}, ... , y_{n}),$ 
then $\v{x}+\v{y}=(x_{1}+y_{1}, x_{2}+y_{2},\dots , x_{n}+y_{n});$ 

\item[scalar multiplication:] if $\v{x}=(x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{n})$ is a vector and $t$ is a scalar, 
then $t\v{x}=(tx_{1}, tx_{2},$  ..., $tx_{n}).$ 
\end{description}
A closed set of objects obeying these rules is a vector space. A single such object
is a vector.
