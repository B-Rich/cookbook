 To solve the  differential equation $ \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + a \frac{dy}{dx}
+ by = f(x), $ we proceed as follows:
\par
Find and solve the auxiliary equation; it has solutions m and n.
\par
Find the complementary function:
\par
If m and n are distinct and real, the complementary
function is $ y = Ae^{mx} + Be^{nx} ; $
\par
If m and n are real and equal, the CF is $ y = Ae^{mx} + Bxe^{mx} ; $
\par
If m and n are complex, with m=a+bi, n=a-bi, then the CF
is $ y = e^{ax} ( A \sin (bx) + B \cos (bx) ) . $
\par
Next find a particular integral, by setting $y=P(x)=px^{2}+qx+r$  or similar, 
substituting into the original equation and equating coefficients of 
like terms to find p, q and r. (The form of P(x) which we guess should 
be the same as the form of f(x), though often with an extra term -
for instance if f(x) is a linear function we would let P(x) be a quadratic.)
\par
Now, the general solution is equal to the general CF, plus the 
particular integral.
