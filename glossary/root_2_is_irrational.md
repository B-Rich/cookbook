!['   the square root of (2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3495.1..png)
is irrational.

Justification: If
!['   the square root of (2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3495.2..png)
were rational we could write
!['   the square root of (2) = (p)/(q)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3495.3..png)
with p, q integers having no common factors. But then we have
!['  2 = (p\^2)/(q\^2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3495.4..png) by
squaring both sides, and 2q^2^=p^2^.\
 The left hand side has a factor of 2, so the right hand side must also
have a factor of 2, so p must be divisible by 2, ie we can write p=2r.
Then we have 2q^2^=4r^2^ or q^2^=2r^2^. This means that q must have a
factor of 2. So p and q have a common factor of 2, which contradicts our
assumption that p and q have no common factors. So we conclude that we
cannot write
!['   the square root of (2)  '](../dictionary/equation_images/3495.5..png)
as a fraction, so it is irrational.
