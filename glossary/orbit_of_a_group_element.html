<p>Given a group G and an element g of G, the orbit of g in G is the set of elements which are generated by g, i.e. <span>g, <span class="math"><em>g</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>g</em><sup>3</sup>, </span> ...</span>. It is a subgroup of G, isomorphic to the cyclic group of order N where <span class="math"><em>g</em><sup><em>N</em></sup> = <em>I</em>.</span></p>
