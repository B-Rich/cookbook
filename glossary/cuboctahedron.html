<p>The 12nd uniform polyhedron is the Cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2|3 4. Its dual is the rhombic dodecahedron. It can be formed by truncating a cube, or by truncating an octahedron.</p>
<p>The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,4,3,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.</p>
<p>It has:</p>
<p>Euler characteristic: 2</p>
<p>Density: 1</p>
<p>Number of vertices: 12</p>
<p>Number of edges: 24</p>
<p>Number of faces: 14 (=6 quadrilaterals and 8 triangles).</p>
