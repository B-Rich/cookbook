The equation of any non-vertical plane can be written in the form
z=mx+ny+c. The plane intersects the z-axis at z=c.

It is more usual to write the equation of a plane using vectors.

Given a point A with position vector **a** and a normal vector **n**,
the plane perpendicular to **n** through **a** has cartesian equation:
n~1~x+n~2~y+n~3~z+d=0, where d=-**a**.**n**.
