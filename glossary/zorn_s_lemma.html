<p>Let S be a non-empty collection of sets. A non-empty subset C of S is said to be a chain if <span class="math">for any A and B  ∈ C, either A ⊆ B or B  ⊆ A.</span></p>
<p>Suppose that whenever C is a chain in S, then <span class="math">⋃<sub>D ∈ C</sub></span> is an element in S. Then S contains a maximal element.</p>
<p>Or, more generally, if <span class="math"> ≤ </span> is a partial order on a non-empty set S and every chain in S has an upper bound, then S has a maximal element.</p>
